lot in life.<br />\r\nThey are fighting something they do not understand. It is as if something invisible comes and blocks their progress just before they reach their goal.<br />\r\nSomething keeps them from leading a life of victory and fruitfulness. This invisible barrier that seems to plague many Christians of good standing, is what this we are talking about today.<br />\r\nThis barrier often leaves a person and it&rsquo;s family members frustrated, confused, or in total despair.<br />\r\nIn some families, this invisible barrier causes unemployment. Then we find that in that particular family almost everybody struggles with getting employment or each time they are employed, they lose their jobs.<br />\r\nThis may happen even in cases where people are well educated. The paradox is that this phenomenon seems to affect both the Christians and the non-Christians within a family.<br />\r\nThis invisible barrier is called a curse. Curses bring shame, embarrassment, frustration, and mockery.<br />\r\nGod never intended for any of His children to live under a curse. That is why He sent His Son to become a curse for us. &quot;&quot;Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us&rdquo; ... .&quot;(Galatians 3:13).<br />\r\nIt is possible to break this invisible barrier through the power of the Cross of Calvary!<br />\r\nAnti-breakthrough decrees, be revoked, in the name of Jesus.<br />\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

of whom shall I be afraid? When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell. Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident. (Psalm 27:1-3).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make this power confession before you continue.<br />\r\nI announce that greater is the One that is in me than any devil on the side of my enemies. It is written, the righteous is as bold as a lion. By my faith in Christ Jesus, I am righteous. I receive my divine boldness. The angels of the Lord encamped round about them that fear Him. The angels of God are with me, I have no basis to fear any man, any evil, any evil spirit. Because the Lord of hosts is with me, I take my confidence in Him. It is written If God be for us who can be against us? God is with me, I have no enough reason to fear, in the name of Jesus. It is written, The Lord is my light and my salvation whom shall, I fear? The Lord is the defense of my life of whom shall I be afraid? Though a host of demons encamp against me, my heart will not fear; though war rises against me, even in this I shall be confident. The Lord is with me like a mighty terrible one. I am not afraid. I cannot be threatened. My persecutors shall stumble and fumble. Their everlasting confusion and disgrace shall never be forgotten. God has commanded me to fear not. Of the 366 days in a year, no single day is allowed for me to fear. So, I refuse to be afraid of anything. You spirit of fear, you are not in God&#39;s agenda for me. I dismiss you from my life now, in the name of Jesus. Jesus said even the very hairs of my head are not only counted but numbered. Not one single strand can be removed without God&#39;s knowledge and permission.

However, curses are not playthings and are profoundly emotionally disturbing for those who experience them. They are not just angry words or swear words; they are acts of power in the spiritual and physical realm. Curses are mentioned over 200 times in Scripture, and were foundational to the Old Covenant (Deuteronomy 28-30).<br />\r\nGod Himself was the first one to pronounce curses on the earth, on Eve&rsquo;s fertility, Adams destiny and upon the serpent. Curses are not just a primitive superstition; they are spiritual pronouncements recorded in Scripture, that profoundly affect the very structure of reality in some way, and are so much in great force today.<br />\r\nToday, we think of &quot;cursing&quot; as someone using foul language, profanity, or perhaps, even blasphemous words against God. Our definition usually is synonymous with &quot;swearing.&quot; This is a form of cursing, but it is only a small portion of what curses mean in the Bible. Cursing in the Bible is not only speaking evil of someone, but evil coming upon someone. If a person is under a curse, according to the Bible, evil has come upon them in some way.

I decree that all the elements of this year will cooperate with me. &nbsp;I decree that these elemental forces should refuse to cooperate with my enemies. I speak unto the sun, the moon and the stars. They must not smite me. I pull down every negative energy planning to operate against my life this year. This is the year the Lord has made; I will rejoice and be glad in it. I dismantle any power uttering incantations to capture this year. &nbsp;I render such incantations and satanic prayer null and void. &nbsp;I retrieve this year out of their hands, in the name of Jesus. Spirits of favour, counsel, might and power, come upon me, in the name of Jesus. I shall excel this year and nothing shall defile me. I shall posses the gates of my enemies.<br />\r\n2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Lord shall anoint me with the oil of gladness above my fellows. &nbsp;The fire of the enemy shall not burn me. &nbsp;My ears shall hear good news and I shall not hear the voice of the enemy. My future is secured in Christ, in the name of Jesus. God has created me to do some definite services. He has committed into my hands some assignments which He has not committed to anybody. He has not created me for nothing. I shall do good. I shall do His work. I shall be an agent of peace. &nbsp;I will trust Him in whatever I do and wherever I am. &nbsp;I can never be thrown away or downgraded. There will be no poverty of body, soul and spirit in my life this year. The anointing of God upon my life gives me favour in the eyes of God and man all the days of my life.

Ipsum?\r\nLorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\r\n\r\nWhy do we use it?\r\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like)."}}, {"model": "armyofjesuschrist.video", "pk": 1, "fields": {"video":
