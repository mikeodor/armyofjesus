But, there are and is clothes, timeless and pleasing to God, biblical, practical and motivating, it challenges women (young or old), to discover the truth about clothing and modesty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is the culture dictating the contents of our closet? Or are we dressing first and foremost to please God? Modesty is more than the length of your skirt or the cut of your blouse. But, its an issue of the heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that modesty starts in the heart. Its a heart issue before its a clothing issue. But, the principle of creation understanding, showed that men and women are different and wired differently by God!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Men are affected more by what they see, by the visual.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; Women are stimulated more by touch and relationship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anybody who&rsquo;s married knows that this is true. But its not just true sexually, its even true in other matters of morality, dress and so on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most common thoughts women have when it comes to matter of clothing is, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it, if guys struggle morally because of what I wear. Its up to the guys to control their minds. I shouldn&rsquo;t have to change the way I dress just because they can&rsquo;t control themselves.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or, &ldquo;Why should we have to make so many adjustments as women just because the guys can&rsquo;t control their minds? Is this really my problem?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mrs. Richard Baxter said, &quot;we as women need to walk in this world as if we were holding a candle walking into a room filled with straw or gunpowder.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Women need to be so careful that they don&#39;t by carelessness or our suggestiveness or anything about appearance or behavior that they don&#39;t light a match to fuel fleshly or sinful lust on the part of men. This is part of the responsibility of every women, except a women of easy virtues or prostitute or an unbeliever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reasons is that, we Christians are a family. The Scripture says in 1 Timothy 5:1-2 &quot;Treat younger men like brothers, and older women like mothers, younger women like sisters, in [all] purity&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the family of God, we are a family. It means we have to take care of each other, to think in terms of others and not just ourselves.Women are to be modestly under the principle of edification. To edify means &ldquo;to build up, to encourage or to strengthen.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Scripture we&#39;re told that we have a responsibility in the family of God to build one another up, to help each other, not just to live for ourselves for Hebrews 10: 24 says, &quot;Let us consider [think about] how to stir up one another to love and good works.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When women go into churches or to the workplace or whatever, do you go thinking, &ldquo;How can I encourage these men to be more godly?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m a candle walking into that room. I have a lot of power, a lot of influence, if I use that candle in the wrong way, I may cause a fire. I may cause an explosion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The principle of edification says, &quot;I&#39;m willing to live according to the law of love.&quot; What&rsquo;s the law of love? It says, I have a commitment to do what is best for others rather than wanting to live my life selfishly, just doing what pleases me. Romans 13:10 tells us that &quot;Love does no wrong to a neighbor, therefore love is the fulfilling of the law&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you truly and rightly loved God and men around you, the men in the Body of Christ, then you have fulfilled the law of God. The law of love says, &quot;I don&#39;t want to defraud the men who are in my life, the men that God puts around me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, what does it mean to defraud. Its an old-fashioned word that means &ldquo;to deceive, to lead someone on or astray.&rdquo; It means &ldquo;to create an expectation that you cannot righteously fulfill; one who dresses in such a way that teases, seduces or tantalizes or tempts the men.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, as a woman dresses or walks or conducts herself in such a way that invites men, she is saying, &quot;I&#39;m available; lm prepared to play the game as you can see, here&#39;s my body. Its an open invitation; come to my party,&quot; and if she then says, &quot;I don&#39;t really want you at my party. I didn&#39;t mean it. Oh, I don&rsquo;t want to do that! I don&#39;t want to get sexually involved; I just wanted to dress in such a way that I was sending you an invitation.&quot; Then he says, &quot;I&#39;m accepting your invitation. I&#39;m coming to your party.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She says, &quot;Oh, no, no, that&#39;s not what I had in mind.&quot; You know what she just did. She defrauded that man. She created an expectation that she could not righteously fulfill. Most Christian women I think don&#39;t realize when they&#39;re sending an invitation. They don&#39;t set out to defraud for the most part, but there dress and conduct do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, there are many women who do it intentionally and consciously, but I think very few Christian women are kind of clueless when it comes to some of these things. We&#39;re just fitting in; we&#39;re just doing what everyone else does. We&#39;re doing what comes naturally and don&#39;t realize that we are defrauding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are a part of a family, and we are responsible for those in our family who are weak. In many cases, that relates to men. That doesn&#39;t make men stupid or foolish. It doesn&#39;t mean that women aren&#39;t weak, but, they are just weak in different areas as men and women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Romans 15:1 tells us, &quot;We who are strong have an obligation to bear with the failings of the weak, and not to please ourselves.&quot; Ladies, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re in the family of God, if you&rsquo;re a child of God and submitting to Jesus, you have an obligation not to live for yourself.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So in answer to the question, &quot;Why should I have to change my clothing just because the guys around me can&#39;t handle it?&quot; The answer is that we&#39;re family. We have an obligation to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves. As Romans 15:2-3 says &quot;Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to build him up.&quot; There&#39;s that word to edify him. &quot;For even Christ did not please himself, but as it is written, &#39;The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, some men in this world and some men even in our churches are wicked. They have wicked hearts, wicked intentions, and they will lust after women regardless of what you can do to prevent it. So in the case of those men, why would you want to help them sin? Why would you want to put further temptation in their path?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, there&#39;s a whole other category of men and lots of these men in our churches, who are not wicked. They have a heart for God; they want to be godly men; they&#39;re not wicked. But as one writer says, &quot;Your brethren in Christ may be weak.&quot; Just weak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think King David fit into this. The Scripture says &quot;He was a man after God&#39;s own heart&quot; in Acts 13:22. He was a man who wanted to please the Lord. He didn&#39;t get up that morning and say, &quot;I think I&#39;m going to lust after a woman. I think I&#39;m going to commit adultery. I think I&#39;m going to kill this man so I can have his wife.&quot; He didn&#39;t have wicked intent initially, but he was weak. He was particularly weak in the presence of an undressed woman, and most men are and would be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your Brethren in Christ may be weak, and the devil does all it can do, to weaken them further. They are forced to live in a world where they are continually bombarded with sights, which are designed by the enemy of their souls to weaken their morals and destroy their purity of heart, but must Christian women help the devil to do his work well, good and perfectly?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Must they make themselves a tool, a temptation to their brethren, even in the congregation of God? You women need to understand the fierce and bitter conflict in the souls of your brethren when you arouse their desires by the careless display of your feminine beautiful organs that ought to be covered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you love God, serving and following Jesus, and you wants to fulfill the principle and law of love! You would not plead for your right to dress as you please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact is, you have no such right. You have no right to destroy by your careless dress, the brother for whom Christ died. &ldquo;You were bought with a price and are not your own&rdquo; says 1 Corinthians 6:20.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are duty bound to glorify God in your body, to clothe that body not as you will but as God wills, and a little love for the souls of your brethren would remove forever from your heart the desire to dress as you please.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question isWHY DON&#39;T WE DEFER?Why don&#39;t we limit our liberty for the sake of our Christian brothers? Why aren&#39;t we more careful?Why are we so bent on dressing in ways that the world and Satan knows are designed to attract sexual attention? Why?Christ says if we are not building with Him, then we are scattering...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keith Green says, &ldquo;Unfortunately, it seems that many Christians are lost in their own selfish little world, either oblivious or uncaring about the effect and responsibilities they have on others. They may even appear to have a real excitement and love for the Lord; but, their dressing, body and conducts is sending out a totally different message&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keith Green a Christian woman says, &ldquo;I know, because I have done it, partly in ignorance but mostly in rebellion. I can remember thinking, &quot; Well, it&#39;s not my fault that they can&#39;t keep their eyes off me and on the Lord. They just aren&#39;t spiritual enough. Why should I have to change just because they are weak? The Lord showed me it was my fault&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She continued &ldquo;I was responsible for causing my brother to stumble, and it had to change. Once I really saw the damage my selfishness was doing to others and to the Lord, I was really ashamed of myself and embarrassed that I had been representing Jesus in such an unbecoming way&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Jesus said to us in Luke 17:1, &quot;It&#39;s inevitable that stumbling blocks should come [there&#39;s going to be women in this world who dress sensually], but woe to those through whom they come!&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the Scripture gives an example of a man in the Old Testament, Job, who said, &ldquo;I have made a covenant with my eyes. How can I gaze at a virgin? I&rsquo;m going to guard my eyes&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We think of that as being a verse for men, and it is, and it should be. They need to make a covenant with their eyes, to guard their eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Could I suggest that women need to make a covenant, too? They need to make a covenant that by God&rsquo;s grace they will never dress or conduct themselves in a way that would cause men to be sexually stimulated by the sight of what they see in them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paul tells us that he would gladly give up eating meat if it caused a brethren to stumble. Of course, we do not advocate giving up clothes, only ones that cause guys to stumble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ask yourself a few questions about your current clothing choices:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What do my clothing and external appearance communicate about who I am and what I believe?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Which aspects of the world&rsquo;s philosophy have I adopted?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do I need to make any changes in the way I think about my dress or appearance?Please tackle this question? You&rsquo;ll have time to pray about them, record your thoughts, and reflect on actions you need to take.

And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dead bones would live.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sick shall be healed!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Demons shall be cast out!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lam shall walk!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deaf shall hear!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The dumb shall talk!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But they needed and need to &quot;Hear the word of the Lord.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Word of God is more powerful than we can ever imagine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Hebrews 4:12 says, &ldquo;For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ezekiel 37:10 &ldquo;So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army&rdquo;.</p>"}}, {"model": "armyofjesuschrist.latestsermon", "pk": 3, "fields": {"title": "THE LESSON OF PLAGUE", "by": "Pastor Eric C Okechukwu", "date": "2020-05-26T13:48:39Z", "image": "sermons_pic/92954529_2509080206021525_4763922255220572160_n.jpg", "word": "<p>Our response to plagues begins with some of Jesus&rsquo;s most famous teachings: &ldquo;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you&rdquo;; &ldquo;Love your neighbor as yourself&rdquo;; &ldquo;Greater love has no man than this, that he should lay down his life for his friends.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Christian ethic in a time of plague considers that our own life must always be regarded as less important than that of our neighbor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During plague periods in the Roman Empire, Christians made a name for themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Antonine Plague of the 2nd century, which might have killed off a quarter of the Roman Empire, led to the spread of Christianity, as Christians cared for the sick and offered, spiritual model whereby plagues were not the work of angry and capricious deities but the product of a broken Creation in revolt against a loving God.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the more famous epidemic is the Plague of Cyprian, named after a bishop it took its life. It helped set off the Crisis of the Third Century and triggered the explosive growth of Christianity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cyprian&rsquo;s sermons told Christians not to grieve for plague victims (who live in heaven), but to redouble efforts to care for the living. Also, bishop Dionysius described how Christians, &ldquo;Heedless of danger &hellip; took charge of the sick, attending to their every need.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even, a pagan Emperor Julian says of how &ldquo;the Galileans&rdquo; cared for even non-Christian sick people, while, the church historian Pontianus recounts how Christians ensured that &ldquo;good was done to all men, not merely to the household of faith.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This habit of sacrificial care has always reappeared throughout history. In 1527, Martin Luther stayed and ministered to the sick. Though his daughter Elizabeth died. But it produced a tract, &ldquo;Whether Christians Should Flee the Plague,&rdquo; Luther provides an answer: We die at our posts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christian doctors cannot abandon their hospitals, Christian governors cannot flee their districts, Christian pastors cannot abandon their congregations. The plague does not dissolve our duties, but, it turns them to crosses, on which we must be prepared to die.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Christians, its better that we should die serving. And if we care for each other, if we share masks and hand soap and canned foods, if we &ldquo;are our brother&rsquo;s keeper,&rdquo; we might actually reduce the death toll, too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Caring for the sick sounds nice, but its as likely to infect others as to save lives. In an intensely professionalized medical environment, should common people really assume a burden of care?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our bodies are gifts from God and must be protected, and we must not &ldquo;tempt God.&rdquo; Duetronmy 6:16 (&ldquo;Though shalt not murder&rdquo;) by even to endanger others through our negligence or recklessness. So, believers must obey quarantine orders, fumigate their houses, and take precautions to avoid spreading the sickness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Christian motive for hygiene and sanitation does not arise in self-preservation but in an ethic of service to our neighbor. We wish to care for the afflicted, first and foremost, but, not infecting the healthy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its interesting to know that early Christians created the first hospitals in Europe as hygienic places to provide care during times of plague, on the understanding that negligence that spread disease further was, in fact, murder. Exodus 20; 13 &quot;You shall not murder&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first sacrifice Christians must make to care for our neighbor is our convenience, as we enthusiastically participate in aggressive sanitation measures and social distancing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This kind of humble care for others is a powerful force. The ubiquitous surgical masks may not actually prevent infection, but they serve as a visible reminder that we&rsquo;re all watching each other&rsquo;s backs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When good sanitary procedure stops being about saving our own skin and starts being about loving our neighbor, it becomes not just life-saving but soul-enlivening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This brings me to one of the more controversial elements of historic Christian plague ethics: We don&rsquo;t cancel church. The whole motivation of personal sacrifice to care for others, and other-regarding measures to reduce infection, presupposes the existence of a community in which we&rsquo;re all stakeholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even as we take communion from separate plates and cups to minimize risk, forgo hand-shaking or hugging, and sit at a distance from each other, we still commune in the Lord.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some observers will view this as a kind of fanaticism, but its not. The coronavirus leaves over 95 percent of its victims still breathing. But it leaves virtually every member of society afraid, anxious, isolated, alone, and wondering if anyone would even notice if they&rsquo;re gone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an increasingly atomized society, the coronavirus could rapidly mutate into an epidemic of despair. Church attendance serves as a societal roll call. Those who don&rsquo;t show up should be checked on during the week. Bereft of work, school, public gatherings, sports and hobbies, or even the outside world at all, humans do poorly. We need the moral and mental support of communities to be the decent people we all aspire to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Christian choice to defend the weekly gathering at church is not, then, a superstitious fancy. Its a clear-eyed, rational choice to balance trade-offs and a Scriptural mandate. We forgo other activities and take great pains to be as clean as possible so that we can meaningfully gather to support each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without this moral support, life can quickly become unendurable. Even non-Christians who eschew church-going can appreciate the importance of maintaining just one lifeline to a community of mutual care and support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be eager to sacrifice for others, even at the cost of your own life. Obsessively maintain a scrupulous hygienic routine to avoid infecting others. Maintain a lifeline to a meaningful human community that can care for your mind and soul.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are the guiding stars that have shepherded Christians through countless plagues for millennia. As the world belatedly wakes up to the fact that the age of epidemics is not over, these ancient ideas still have modern relevance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>THE LESSONS OF CORONA-PLAGUE</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1) It Changes Church worship!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Congregations are creatures of habit. Churches are built on traditions, liturgies, and order in worship. Over time, every church&rsquo;s line between what is fundamental to the faith and what is merely institutionalized response gets blurred. But, CORONA Plague presents a needed moment of doctrinal stocktaking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest lesson for me has been navigating the road between wisdom and ignorance. Its tough as ignorance often has a way to masquerade itself as wisdom. How many precautionary measures are actually sound judgment?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its a tough road to navigate, as we had to both convey safety to our members, by way of implementing recommended health measures and yet not succumb to the cultural climate of ignorance, fear, and self-preservation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We do so in all our notices by ensuring that we are not just communicating measures but also casting a vision for how to be the people of God in this time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In practical terms, a church&rsquo;s response will vary depending on its doctrine, local context, and exposure to suspected cases of COVID-19. There is no correct answer; all are seeking the most appropriate response in extraordinary times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Precautions that churches have taken to maintain services include:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To suspend their services entirely. We have to take the unprecedented step of suspending gathering, advising congregants to continue to fulfill their spiritual obligations by tuning in to online and Tv sermons, spending time in prayer, and reading the Word at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2) Be a Strong Leader and a Guidance! In moments of crisis, people are looking for leadership. The first responsibility of the leader is to remain calm. Be you a father or a mother. Panic causes tunnel vision, which is terrible for decision-making. Strong leadership reminds people that God is in control of every situation and there is never a reason to panic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Praying, reading your Bible and researching process will drove you seeking divine wisdom in an unprecedented situation. It pours divine grace, provision and solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest lesson that I have learned dealing with COVID-19 is the need to be humbler as a church leader. There is so much that I do not know and have to learn. And that increases my desire and the need to seek the face of the Lord daily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the virus continues to spread globally, church leaders around the world should be aware that their flocks are watching their shepherds intently. Signals of faithfulness will have implications long after the COVID-19 season is over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A leader&rsquo;s action is a theological statement! As leaders, we need to have a theological stance on all things. We need to process our fears before God and let our actions be inspired by faith and guided by sound theology. Let not disease, or earthly decree, but doctrine guide our decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3) Taking Advantages of Technology! While the government has said an upgrade to the Red risk assessment level. The local churches have to explore and install or improve their audio and video recording and live-streaming instruments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its a wonderful time for the ecclesia to exercise practical wisdom and explore creative methods of ministry. Its Time to introduce Instant Message Broadcast and Live Video Streaming workshop and IT specialists to host a &ldquo;Livestream Church Service&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is need for Bible Study Fellowship&rsquo;s Life transmission to members. The move to livestreaming will strengthened the church community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have to be on a journey of rethinking our understanding of church. The church today must be a people of purpose that are willing to go beyond the constraints of &lsquo;place&rsquo; or &lsquo;program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4) Its a eime Prayer! For such a time as this, unity is the key, a local prayer and church unity movement, is important. I believe in the power of prayer of agreement. For such a time as this, we need every believer to arise and seek God together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A prophetic act, just like the ringing of church bells, summoning the faithful to action when their village or town is threatened.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its crucial that in times of crisis, the church rises up to be a standard. As salt and light, the church needs to stand strong in the Lord so that others can see the hope we profess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5) Expect Criticism Outside and Inside! Inflammatory comments about race, religion and management must be stopped and erased! The criticism is unfortunate but unavoidable; non-Christians cannot be expected to understand the tenets and teachings of our faith.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But more painful is the criticism that has come from fellow Christians with every decision their leaders have to make. Decide to suspend services, and be castigated for a lack of faith. Decide to continue to gather, and be derided as socially irresponsible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be prepared to go deeper into prayer and Bible reading than you&rsquo;ve ever gone. Be prepared for the reality that your decisions will not please everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crisis shows the true character of a Christian. The anxiety around COVID-19 will allow you to really discern the spiritual state of your flock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we respond to this crisis correctly, it can turn out to be a defining moment of discipleship for our community. In the face of imminent dangers, our priorities are rearranged. This is a great opportunity to have deep conversations about what we are living for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are we merely existing, or are we truly living? Are we living for the right stuff? Are we marching to the right drumbeat? Are we governed by biblical or worldly values? Are we living for what really matters?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6) Love your neighbor! While much of the secular world&rsquo;s response to the virus has been inward-looking, driven by fear, many Christian agree that the COVID-19 situation presents a God-given chance to shine in the darkness of the moment. However, for that to happen, the Christians must look beyond its own concerns and awaken to the opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the distinct things that we wanted to affect was the atmosphere of the community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can never fully remove these negative elements in society, &ldquo;but what we can do is ensure that there are more positive vibes being generated than negative ones. So we sent our people out to care, to be kind and go the extra mile to help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among other efforts, Christians have to reached out to many who have been unable to earn a living because of lockdown, whose business and source of income has been badly affected. This is a must inside and outside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christians have to kick start many acts of love and kindness, as Viruses is spreading, alsi kindness, care and love is infectious too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyone who stands in a relationship of service to another has a vocational commitment not to flee. Those in ministry, must remain steadfast before the peril of death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The sick and dying need a good shepherd who will strengthen and comfort them and administer the communion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today&rsquo;s condition challenges Christians to see opportunities to tend to the sick as tending to Christ himself (Matt. 25:41&ndash;46). Out of love for God emerges the practice of love for neighbor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I don&rsquo;t encourage anyone to expose itself recklessly to danger. I mean one honoring the sanctity of one&rsquo;s own life, and honoring the sanctity of those in need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God gives humans a tendency toward self-protection and trusts that they will take care of their bodies (Eph. 5:29; 1 Cor. 12:21&ndash;26). All of us, have the responsibility of warding off this poison to the best of our ability because God has commanded us to care for the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I advise that public health measures such as quarantines and seeking medical attention when available is a must and not to do so is to act recklessly. Just as God has gifted humans with their bodies, so too he has gifted the medicines of the earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though God&rsquo;s children face earthly sufferings, those who proclaim faith in Christ share in a heavenly promise of freedom from illness and suffering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jesus Christ peace is not to remove us from disaster and death, but rather to have peace in the midst of disaster and death, because Christ has already overcome these things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7) Amid bad news in the headlines, the Good News of Jesus Christ is more relevant than ever! The world has a virus infection that is far greater than all the viruses we&rsquo;ve ever known throughout its history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That virus is sin. And with this virus, there is absolutely no immunity, no survivors, and no hope. And it infects 100 percent of all humanity. No one is spared from this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The world is in need of a Savior. The world is in need of salvation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Headlines that regularly ratchet up the local and global death counts are daily reminders of our mortality, forcing everyone to look beyond the routines of life and to consider what lies beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that we all will someday die, by COVID-19 or otherwise. Its a matter of urgency that a Christian is able to look beyond our present difficulties and look out for opportunities to share the hope that we have in Jesus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We need conversations on deeper issues. Is the meaning of life and our time on this earth the prolonging and preservation of life for as long as possible? Is it to be occupied with temporal things, material wealth and comfort? Or is it to fulfill Jesus&rsquo; desire to see all the rooms in our Father&rsquo;s house that he has prepared being filled to the brim?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This starts with a public, visible expression of the victory and hope that we have in Jesus. There is an unprecedented opportunity to share the reason for our posture of faith amid fearful times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We do not live as those without hope that&rsquo;s what the gospel is all about! But we have friends, neighbors, and family who do not know that hope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They may open up to share their fears and concerns during such crisis. As the Old Testament prophet wrote in Daniel 12:3, &lsquo;Those who are wise shall shine like the brightness of the sky above; and those who turn many to righteousness, like the stars forever and ever.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The panic is tangible, also the love of the church can be tangible too. These are gospel moments. We can spread love, not fear and nor the virus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s not waste this opportunity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a climate of fear surrounding the outbreak, I come back to the scripture commitment to caring for the sick, whether they have coronavirus, tuberculosis, or influenza. Precautions, we shall take, yes. But we are reminded by the scripture that they are individuals deserving of care all the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;When did we see you sick?&rdquo; ask the righteous in the parable of the sheep and the goats, to which Jesus responds, &ldquo;Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me&rdquo; (Matt. 25:39&ndash;40).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If and when the coronavirus encroaches upon our communities, how will we faithfully respond?</p>"}}, {"model": "armyofjesuschrist.latestsermon", "pk": 4, "fields": {"title": "The Power  and Freedom  of Forgiveness", "by": "Pastor Eric C Okechukwu", "date": "2020-05-26T13:49:36Z", "image": "sermons_pic/89781153_2480690115527201_7716827930394886144_n.jpg", "word": "<p>(Dear Sister Ngozi Agu, this is the little His grace enabled me to put down for now, forgiveness, as you requested. And it ANSWERED the QUESTION whether FORGIVENESS is for the STRONG or WEAK? Hoping it will be of help to you! Thank you, for giving me something to do)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We all make mistakes. In different spheres of life. They often lead to disagreement, strife, sorrow, anger or a sense of betrayal. Forgiveness is human too! We think of God as the final dispenser of forgiveness, but you and I, have the power to forgive as well. Doing so can help us avoid bitterness and resentment and often will salvage a relationship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When to forgive and how to forgive, is a common question? When you feel mistreated, wronged or hurt by someone. These grudges contribute to the stories you tell yourself, on your own mental playlist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These stories can become emotional yoke and passionate burdens, weighing you down in more ways than you realize. Blaming, whether yourself or others, puts you in the passenger seat, you playing the role of victim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>i. Forgiveness doesn&rsquo;t mean what happened was OK. Forgiveness just means that you&#39;ve made peace with the pain, and you are ready to let it go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ii. Forgiveness is not something we do for others, but its something we do for ourselves. Not forgiving someone is the equivalent of staying trapped in a jail cell of anger and bitterness, serving time for someone else&#39;s crime. You make the choice to either dwell on the pain cause by others or you want to forgive and move on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>iii. Gandhi once said &ldquo;The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong.&quot; It takes a strong person to face pain head-on, forgive, and release it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>iv. Forgiveness isn&rsquo;t always about others, its about forgiving yourself. Anger or guilt never makes anyone feel better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>v. To forgive someone is the highest, most beautiful form of appreciation, compassion and love that bring a sense of peace and happiness in return.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note, always forgiving your enemies, annoys them so much, and paralysis and take away there power. By contrast, forgiving is empowering. You begin to operate from a position of strength rather than vulnerability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forgiveness is a gift. It breaks the cycle of negative energy that can hold you back from fulfilling careers, relationships and lives. It also reaps these benefits!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It Heals! Its impossible to move forward while ruminating over the past. When you forgive, you move the past where it belongs, in the past. Its not that you forget, its that you&rsquo;re not stuck there anymore.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forgiveness can be both cause and effect. Once you begin to heal, you can forgive. And once you forgive, you continue to heal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its Freedom! Resentment is a heavy burden and a yoke. There is an undeniable freedom in letting go of anger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its Self-Confidence! Whatever mistakes you made, whatever feelings of hurt, pain or sadness you felt, you survived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It Resilience builds strength, compassion and confidence. When you forgive, you distance yourself from the influence of the person that hurt you. The challenge doesn&rsquo;t define you; your resilience does.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learning to forgive is a skill, and, like any other, the more you practice, the more natural it becomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forgiving isn&rsquo;t so much an act as it is a process. It begins with an understanding that you are not forgetting, nor are you condoning aggressive, offensive or abusive behavior. Rather, you choose to acknowledge and accept what happened, because it did, and to move on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may need time to process, but processing differs from ruminating. You may learn valuable lessons, about yourself, about others and about your values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forgiveness shift your mindset away from the role of victim. Regardless of the circumstances, you always remain in control over your thoughts and moods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the words of Viktor Frankl, &ldquo;Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom.&rdquo; In that space, there is also opportunity for forgiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ministers of God are to truly invest their life ministry in seeking to see lost people reconciled to God, perfect saints in holliness and for the Church to build bridges instead of fences between its leaders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We so often want ourselves to be forgiven before the Lord, but forget that real forgiveness is demonstrated by how we treat our brothers and sisters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is my opinion that real revival is not just getting the roof off and getting right with God. But, real revival is getting the walls down and getting right with one another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We often need revival, with an emphasis of no roof and no walls. If we want the revival that nothing to separate US from God and nothing to separate US from the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we forgive we set free ourselves and others at the same time. Forgiveness keeps us in right relationship with the Lord and in reconciliation with others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&#39;s a Costly Requirements for Forgiveness!Now, let me talk to you about the costly requirements for forgiveness, because, see, there&#39;s no bargain, forgiveness or no bargain pardons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What does our Scripture say? &quot;Be ye kind, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ&#39;s sake hath forgiven you&quot; (Ephesians 4:32).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, Jesus is the model of our forgiveness since he paid the price. We talked about redemption through His blood. We will have to know a little personal Gethsemane and Calvary if you truly forgive somebody who has deeply hurt you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We Need To Forgive Freely! The Lord&#39;s forgiveness is free, spontaneous, and quick. Don&#39;t forgive after you have collected your revenge. You know, sometimes people hurt us, and we say, &quot;They don&#39;t know how much they hurt me, and I&#39;m going to teach them how much I&#39;ve been hurt. I&#39;m going to make them suffer.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Has anybody ever treated you that way and then finally said, &quot;Well, I&#39;ll forgive you?&quot; What do you feel like saying? &quot;Hey, I don&#39;t need to be forgiven. I&#39;ve already paid.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should be so anxious to forgive a person that you chase them and catch them in order to forgive them. Isn&#39;t that what God has done for us? We love Him why? Because, He first loved us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Adam and Eve sinned against God in the Garden of Eden, God did not sit up there, in Heaven, and say, &quot;Well, I&#39;m going to wait, and if, perhaps, they come to me, I might be persuaded to forgive them.&quot; God came to the garden, and God said, &quot;Adam, Adam, where are you?&quot; (Genesis 3:9).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That wasn&#39;t the voice of a detective. That was the voice of a brokenhearted God who was seeking someone who had sinned against Him, freely seeking to forgive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We read, &quot;Moreover, if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone&quot;-it doesn&#39;t say to go and tell him off; go tell him secretly, privately, lovingly-and &quot;if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother&quot; (Matthew 15:18).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The act of forgiving someone is, in essence, your refusal to let anger and hatred prevent you from moving forward. You are taking a stand against allowing the actions of others to alter the course of your life or who you are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forgiving is not an act of weakness, but an act of great strength. Hanging on to upsetting experiences through our thoughts and words, is a clear message of weakness, immaturity and powerless. Its &quot;drinking poison&quot; and expecting the other person to die? Forgiveness is a perfect sense that only strong individuals are able to forgive?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1) Its a Vibration!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every thought, word, action, and feeling has its own vibration. When you approach the concept of forgiveness from the perspective of the energy or vibration it produces and requires, it takes on an entirely new meaning. You will see that the qualities associated with forgiveness, love, peace, and happiness, are fast, high, empowering vibrational energies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the contrary, the qualities associated with unforgiveness, resentment, anger, hatred, are slow, low, disempowering energies. When you are unforgiving, you are throwing that negative vibrational energy out into the universe for yourself, not them, you!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forgiveness is not about the other person. Forgiveness is about you taking the power back that you have relinquished to them. Its a display of courage and inner strength. It shows that you have so much integrity and love for yourself that you will not have your happiness stolen from you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exhibiting a peaceful nature shows that you are too strong to become offended by others&#39; petty words and behaviors. You show that you are above the actions of another person because their actions are a reflection of their issues and have nothing to do with you and who you are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2) Its a Matter of Freedom! After much of his life had been unfairly spent behind bars, Nelson Mandela had said, &quot;As I walked out the door toward the gate that would lead to my freedom, I knew if I didn&#39;t leave my bitterness and hatred behind, I&#39;d still be in prison.&quot; So, you must ask yourself, &quot;Am I living in an invisible prison because I am unable to forgive?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unforgiveness is a prison of the heart, mind, emotion and passion. People who have hurt you are the cell walls, and your thoughts about them are the steel bars keeping you inside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without forgiveness, moving forward is impossible; the future is limited, and you become stagnant and if prolonged, it brings in retardation. Through unforgiveness, you turn the controls of your emotional and passionate life over to someone else, and there is no freedom in that. Forgiveness and letting go puts you in a place of power and freedom, it benefits you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3) Its About Being Human! Everyone has been both the recipient and the giver of meanness, hostility, and insensitivity, etc., including you and me. It takes a certain degree of awareness, intelligent and elevation in consciousness to recognize that each soul who crosses your path is doing the best they can at their level of understanding and intelligent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The person that has hurt you is a human being, too. We all make mistakes; no one is immune. And because of our humanness, internalizing the slow, debilitating energies of resentment and anger brings harm to us. It blocks our prosperity, our good, our happiness, and above all, our peace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forgiveness has nothing to do with the other person and does not condone their behavior in any way. They do not actually need to be involved in the act of forgiving them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, what I am suggesting is that the quiet contemplation of what your life would be like without their negative influence is important. And possibly the person that you need to forgive is you. Forgiveness is a gift that you give to yourself. The highest form of self-respect and Self-Love, is Self-Forgiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being able to forgive is admirable and shows great courage. Those who cannot forgive are letting their ego get in the way, it shows their poor sense of reasoning, and it shows how, weaken they are. Being strong enough to free one&#39;s Self from the prison of unforgiveness is a choice. Its a chance to be reborn, to fill your mind with peace, to heal, and move on, within that energy lies unlimited strength.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter asked the Lord: &quot;Lord, how many times if a person sins against me, shall I forgive him? Seven times?&quot;-that&#39;s a perfect number (Matthew 18:21).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jesus said: &quot;No, seventy times seven&quot; -four hundred and ninety (Matthew 18:22). And, by inference, He didn&#39;t mean you stopped at four hundred ninety-one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What our Lord says is, &quot;Get the mathematics out of it. Don&#39;t keep score. Forgiveness has no limit. Forget the math.&quot; Forgive freely, even if you have to chase somebody in order to forgive them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We Need To Forgive Fully! Now, if somebody comes to you and says, &quot;I want you to forgive me.&quot; We should not say, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a wrong response. We are to say, &quot;I forgive you. I forgive you.&quot; This is very important. You see, sometimes, when we do wrong, we don&#39;t go to another individual and say, &quot;Forgive me.&quot; We say, &quot;If I have hurt your feelings, I&#39;m sorry. I want to apologize.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The word apologize comes from a Greek word, apologia, which means, &quot;to make a defense.&quot; In apologetics, we&#39;re defending the faith.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So many of us want to apologize. What we&#39;re doing is really defending ourselves. If you&#39;ve wronged somebody, don&#39;t apologize and say, &quot;Would you forgive me? I was wrong. I was wrong.&quot; It&#39;s not an apology that I want. I want forgiveness. And, if somebody has wronged you, don&#39;t say, &quot;Oh, forget it. Never mind.&quot; Say, &quot;I forgive you.&quot; Do it fully. Then it&#39;s buried in the grave of God&#39;s forgetfulness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We Need To Forgive Finally! We should not bring it up again. Isaiah 43, verse 25: &quot;I, even I, am he who blots out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins&quot; (Isaiah 43:25).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sins are buried in the grave of God&#39;s forgetfulness. If you forgive, do it finally, once for all. You may say, &quot;Well, that brings up a problem for me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God doesn&#39;t remember our sins anymore? I thought God was omniscient. How can God ever truly forget anything?&quot; Well, intellectually, God cannot forget. God doesn&#39;t lose His memory. When God says, &quot;I will remember them no more,&quot; that means, &quot;I will not bring them up. I will not use them against you. If I remember them, I remember them as forgiven sins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don&#39;t continue to have that spirit of resentment that human beings tend to have. The sin is buried.&quot; Now, many times we say we have forgiven, but we&#39;ve not forgiven finally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We Need To Forgive! We also forgive forcefully. What do I mean by forcefully? It is not natural to forgive. Our spirits demand justice. &quot;They need to pay. They hurt us and they need to understand just how badly they hurt us.&quot; It has well been said, &quot;To err is human; to forgive is divine.&quot; You need Jesus to be forgiven, and, friend, you need Jesus in order to forgive. &quot;Be ye kind, tenderhearted, forgiving one another&quot; (Ephesians 4:32).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where do we get that kindness? Where do we get that tenderheartedness? It comes from Jesus. The same One who has forgiven us is the One who puts His Spirit in us and enables us to have the force and the power to forgive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Certain Results of Forgiveness! I want you to think about the three-fold results of forgiveness. What will be the certain results of forgiveness?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Personal Emancipation!When there is forgiveness, there is personal emancipation. You&#39;re set free!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mutual Reconciliation! There will be reconciliation. There&#39;s going to be a reconciliation between you and somebody else. You&#39;re going to gain your brother or sister. You&#39;re going to set free your brother or sister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Spiritual Rejuvenation! There will be spiritual rejuvenation. There&#39;s going to be revival. Do you know what real revival is? Real revival is not just getting the roof off and getting right with God. Real revival is getting the walls down and getting right with one another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I find it amazing that Christian leaders often preach forgiveness throughout the earth, but find it difficult to forgive one another or partner with one another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The way we treat our brother and sister is a measurement of how much we truly the sacrifices of Jesus and shows how much we love our heavenly Father.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we strive to win the world, let us be sure to keep our relationships with our brothers and sisters fresh and forgiven.</p>"}}, {"model": "armyofjesuschrist.latestsermon", "pk": 5, "fields": {"title": "THE NEED TO MOTHERS DAYS!", "by": "Pastor Eric C Okechukwu", "date": "2020-05-26T13:50:19Z", "image": "sermons_pic/89909131_2485859885010224_1039507335468285952_n.jpg", "word": "<p>Mothers are the greatest and uncommon teacher of compassion, love and fearlessness. If love is sweet as a flower, then mothers is that sweet flower of love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MOTHERS are walking miracle, as it hold their children&#39;s hands for a short while, but their hearts forever. Mothers are instinctive philosophers, for her heart is a deep abyss at the bottom of which you will always find forgiveness. Of all the rights of women, the greatest is to be a mother.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For MOTHERS are the bank where children deposited all there hurts and worries. All care, zeal and love begins and ends in motherhood, as mothers are readers, she reads the children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a mother is difficult a challenging responsibility that is defiantly underappreciated. Been a mother and doing what mother&rsquo;s do, takes patience and commitment. We should take time to honor our parents, all year long and not just on the &quot;legal&quot; day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A six-year-old boy, separated from his mother in a supermarket, began to call frantically for &ldquo;Esther! Esther! Esther!&rdquo; That was his mother&rsquo;s name and she came running to him quickly. &ldquo;But, honey,&rdquo; she admonished, &ldquo;you shouldn&rsquo;t call me &lsquo;Esther&rsquo;, I&rsquo;m &lsquo;Mother&rsquo; to you.&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;but this store is full of MOTHERS and I have only one MOTHER!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Mother&rsquo;s Day we can&rsquo;t say enough good things about our mothers, but we&rsquo;ll try and God will help us!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1- Her hands work</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2- Her mouth speaks</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3- Her heart loves</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Note that &hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1~My first room, its My mother&#39;s womb</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2~My first restaurant, its My mum&#39;s breast</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3~My first toilet, its My mother&#39;s lap</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4~My first school, its My mum&#39;s kitchen</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5~My first Teacher, its My mum</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6~My first doctor, Its My mum</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7~My first thermometer, its My mum&#39;s finger</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8~My first friend, Its my mum</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9~My first dresser, Its my mum</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10~My first vehicle, My mum&#39;s back</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you mum 4 all you did for me and long life to all mother&#39;s, in Jesus name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A boy got his first job. As he was boasting about the amount of work he did, he said, &quot;I get up at 5 a.m. and have my breakfast.&quot; He was asked, &quot;Does anyone else get up too?&quot; He replied, &quot;Oh yes, mother gets up and fixes my breakfast and then fixes dad&rsquo;s breakfast.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And what about your dinner?&quot; The boy said, &quot;Oh, mother, fixes that too.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Does your mother have the afternoon to herself?&quot; The boy replied, &quot;No, mama cleans the house, looks after the other children, and then gets supper for me and dad when we come home. Then we watch TV before we go to bed.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;What about your mother? What does she do?&quot; The boy replied, &quot;Mama washes some clothes and irons the rest of the evening.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Do you get paid?&quot; &quot;Of course, Dad and I get paid.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;And what about your mother, does she get paid too?&quot; The boy replied, No!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Preacher John Wesley was a student at Oxford University, shocked by the amount of drinking done by the students. After writing to his mother, Susanna Wesley, for her counsel, he received the following words: &quot;My dear son: remember that anything which increases the authority of the body over the mind is an evil thing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A London editor submitted to Winston Churchill for his approval a list of all those who had been Churchill&rsquo;s teachers. Churchill returned the list with this comment: &ldquo;You have omitted to mention the greatest of my teachers, my Mother.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thomas Edison once said, &ldquo;I did not have my mother long, but she cast over me an influence which has lasted all my life. The good effects of her early training I can never lose. If it had not been for her appreciation and her faith in me at a critical time in my experience, I should never likely have become an inventor. I was always a careless boy, and with a mother of different mental caliber, I should have turned out badly. But her firmness, her sweetness, her goodness, were potent powers to keep me in the right path. My mother was the making of me. The memory of her will always be a blessing to me.&rdquo; What a loving tribute to a blessed mother, even Proverbs 31:28 says &ldquo;Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Preacher G. Campbell Morgan had four sons and they all became ministers of the gospel. At a family reunion, a friend asked one of the sons, &quot;Which Morgan is the greatest preacher?&quot; While that son looked at his father, he replied, &quot;MOTHER.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mother was the greatest teacher and preacher. Many mothers have done a lot of teachings and preachings to their children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank your MOTHER for caring enough to tell you what was what.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thomas Edison said above, Proverbs 22:6 &ldquo;Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from It&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every Godly MOTHER realizes that when Gods way is implemented early in a child&rsquo;s life and within the home lifelong habits are established. God knew long before science figured it out that being a MOTHER and raising a family would be a very demanding and difficult thing to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scripture in Proverbs 18:22 says, &ldquo;Whoso finds a wife finds a good thing, and obtains favour of the LORD&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a child has a good MOTHER, that child is indeed blessed and favoured. Sadly, many of us do not realize how good our mother are until they are no more and we cannot show them the honor they deserve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its not easy raising a child at any time in life and as history can prove, but our MOTHERS did not care or matter the condition of life, time and season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many men often pick women with the qualities of their MOTHER. MOTHERS have eternal impact on their children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember that Jesus loved His MOTHER very much, He did to teach us to love our MOTHER! When He said &hellip; &ldquo;MOTHER see your SON and SON see your MOTHER&rdquo;&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the family of God, we have access to many MOTHERS. Jesus said that whoever does the will of God is His mother. Those women are my mothers also. The whole concept of the aged is that these women are experienced and wise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, not every woman with silver hair is wise or walking in holiness, and not every young woman is ignorant or spiritually immature. The whole issue is that the most experienced and most godly women are to teach the inexperienced and spiritually immature. There must be spiritual discernment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Titus 2:3-5 &ldquo;3The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things; 4That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children, 5To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right things are not taught in our schools, the media, and often not by genetic mothers. How shall the young women know if spiritual mothers do not teach them?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Good Lord created MOTHERS very special! With a smile, laugh and a kiss, MOTHERS can cure anything from a broken leg to a disappointed love affair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God gave MOTHERS Six pairs of hands and three pairs of eyes. One pair that sees through closed doors when she asks, &#39;What are you kids doing in there?&#39; when she already knows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another is in the back of her head that sees what she shouldn&#39;t but what she has to know, and of course the ones here in front that can look at a child when he goofs up and say. &#39;I understand and I love you&#39; without so much as uttering a word.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another is that that heals herself when she is sick, can feed a family of six on one pound of hamburger or little or nothing and can get a nine year old to stand under a shower.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The MOTHERS model is too soft but very tough! You can imagine what this mother can do or endure. Not only can it think, but it can reason and compromise. Then across the cheek of MOTHERS there&#39;s a leak, but not a leak, rather its a tear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&#39;s it for?&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s for joy&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its for sadness&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its for disappointment&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its for pain&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its for endurance&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its for forcus&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its for loneliness&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And its for pride!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is something so special about MOTHERSin Proverbs 31:10-31 &ldquo;10 If you can find a truly good wife, she is worth more than precious gems! 11Her husband can trust her, and she will richly satisfy his needs. 12She will not hinder him but help him all her life. 13She finds wool and flax and busily spins it. 14She buys imported foods brought by ship from distant ports. 15She gets up before dawn to prepare breakfast for her household and plans the day&rsquo;s work for her servant girls. 16She goes out to inspect a field and buys it; with her own hands she plants a vineyard. 17She is energetic, a hard worker, 18and watches for bargains. She works far into the night! 19-20She sews for the poor and generously helps those in need. 21She has no fear of winter for her household, for she has made warm clothes for all of them. 22She also upholsters with finest tapestry; her own clothing is beautifully made&mdash;a purple gown of pure linen. 23Her husband is well known, for he sits in the council chamber with the other civic leaders. 24She makes belted linen garments to sell to the merchants. 25She is a woman of strength and dignity and has no fear of old age. 26When she speaks, her words are wise, and kindness is the rule for everything she says. 27She watches carefully all that goes on throughout her household and is never lazy. 28Her children stand and bless her; so does her husband. He praises her with these words: 29&ldquo;There are many fine women in the world, but you are the best of them all!&rdquo; 30Charm can be deceptive and beauty doesn&rsquo;t last, but a woman who fears and reverences God shall be greatly praised. 31Praise her for the many fine things she does.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These good deeds of hers shall bring her honor and recognition from people of importance&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This verses is describing a woman who is living in a supernatural way with a supernatural God. And it has to be that way because there are few things that are more important to society than godly mothers. The Bible is clear in its teachings, both explicit and implicit, that the family is the foundation of society.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While fathers are responsible for the way the family goes, mothers are the glue that holds the family together. our wives/mothers are to be the keepers of the home while husbands/ fathers supposed to be the protectors of the home! The Scripture says &ldquo;that home is keep by a wisdom of wife&rdquo;&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a MOTHER living in what the Scripture says in Romans 12:2 which says, &ldquo;Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ephesians 5:25-29 &ldquo;Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish. So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church: Husband is to love their wives, just like Jesus loves the Church. We are to love our wives sacrificially. If we fail to love our wives like this, we&rsquo;re disobeying a commandment given to us from God&rsquo;s Word, and we are distorting the picture that marriage provides of Christ and the Church to the world&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ve heard the saying, &ldquo;As goes the home, so goes the Church, and as goes the Church, so goes the world&hellip;&rdquo; Well this passage is where that idea comes from. Christian marriage is a picture of Christ and His Church to the unbelieving world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And secondly; if we fail to love our wives like this, we sin against God, against our wives and our children, because our kids pick up on our attitudes and actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, in Luke chapter 10 we read the story of Mary, Martha and Jesus. Mary found the time to sit at Jesus&rsquo; feet, to be near Him and learn from Him, while Martha kept herself busy with works, she even complained to the Lord about Mary&rsquo;s unwillingness to join her in her sin. I hope everyone realizes that this is the same Mary that goes to the tomb and is the first person to see the resurrected Lord. She was then commissioned to be the very first evangelist. Jesus told her to go and tell the others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And what we learn from that is that MOTHERS need to make Mary&rsquo;s priority their own priority. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that they ignore the other duties of motherhood. It means that they prioritize and have their priorities straight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because MOTHERS who end up making Martha&rsquo;s priorities their own, end up like Martha. They find themselves full of resentment, self-pity and tension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jesus Himself took time to pray and be alone with His heavenly Father.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MOTHERS do you find yourselves so busy that you don&rsquo;t take time to sit at the feet of the Lord and listen to His Word, and take your burdens and cares to Him?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bible makes it pretty clear that no WIFE or HUSBAND or MOTHER OR FATHER, can be the kind of spouse or parent that God has called them to be without the Lords help. Infact; Jesus said, &ldquo;Without Me, you can do nothing!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The woman who finds her value in her looks and beauty will either have so much painting and plastic surgery and Botox done that she&rsquo;ll end up looking like something out of a horror show, or she will devalue her worth to the point of self-loathing, (Because age and gravity eventually sets in on us all). But the woman who fears the LORD, she shall be praised! &ldquo;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom&rdquo;!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MOTHERS, God doesn&rsquo;t call you to be perfect; He calls you to walk in His perfection. &ldquo;Its not by might, nor by power, but by His Spirit &ndash; declares the LORD&rdquo;. So take time to sit at the feet of Jesus, in-other-words, take time to get into the Word of God.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read the Bible, study the Bible, learn the Bible, memorize the Bible&hellip; you do that, and before long, you&rsquo;ll find that you&rsquo;re living the Bible. Compare what God&rsquo;s Word says with what the world says, and if they differ, reject the worlds point of view. And lastly; &ldquo;keep your eyes firmly fixed on Jesus, lay aside every weight of sin that so easily besets us, and look unto the Author and Finisher of your faith&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You must remember and never forget that God choose you to be a MOTHER.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dear MOTHER, you are the greatest gift from heavens, filled with love and care for the family. Your smile and laugh brightens each day just as the morning rays shines on the hills and it&rsquo;s without doubt it gives us the courage to face the new day with joy and purpose. How fortunate and special I am to be blessed with a mother as thoughtful, caring, loving and prayerful as you. You are that good gift, love and favour that is dear, rear and unimaginable that God gave. There&rsquo;s no way I could ever fully express my gratitude for all you&rsquo;ve done. You are so special, wonderful, awesome and phenomenal!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happy MOTHER&#39;S Day!!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its Love from</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pastor Eric C.

Thomas, thank you for your encouragement and apreciation. I hope this shall be of help to you. This is the second part of the teaching about Friend &amp; friendship you requested!)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Friendship is a simple word but carries deep meanings. It cannot be defined by a single phrase or a paragraph as it means different things to different people but to me in deep and naked truth, and Biblically, friendship means being there for each other, not only sharing in joys but sorrows as well, as thus said Galatians 6:2 &quot;Carry each other&rsquo;s burdens, and in this way, you will fulfill the law of Christ.&quot; Friendship is one of the most precious gifts of life, a true friend is the one who you can blindly trust and the one who you can rely on, anytime, anywhere and any season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who are your friends? Sometimes friends are closer than brothers or sisters. Friends are special and unique, they share affection, companionship, confidences, consideration, devotion, esteem, faithfulness, fellowship, harmony, helpfulness, loyalty, partnership, support, sympathy, trust and understanding. The Bible gives and speaks deep meaning of friendship in its naked and sincere reality in Deuteronomy 13:6 says &ldquo;a friend who is as your own soul.&rdquo; Mediate the image of that language in your mind: as your own soul. That is a biblical meaning and level of intimacy that is in friendship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Friendship influences and impact hence Proverbs 13:20 says, &ldquo;He who walk with wise men will be wise, but companion of fools will be destroyed&rdquo;. Those that would be good must keep good company, as evidence, as a persons character is known by the company it chose, because wisdom lies in the choice of our company, for what they are, they will make us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bible is full of examples of this. Think about the amazing friendship of Jonathan and David. Jonathan warned David that his life was in danger at the hands of Jonathan&rsquo;s own father, King Saul. This warning allowed David to take action and avoid harm, and ultimately this act of true friendship allowed David to take the throne, manifest and fulfill destiny, which was God&rsquo;s plan. True friendships are glued together with bonds of loyalty and commitment. They remain intact, despite changing circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Appleby, defined friendship as the great opportunity to demonstrate our capacity for lofty and ennobling relationships without the motive of selfishness. But, I define friendship as a bond that transcends all barriers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Friendship is commitment of the heart, understanding, mutual loyalty and confidence and sharing. It settles for less than perfection and makes allowances for human weaknesses. Finding a true friend feels like a gift that keeps on giving, even when they are thousands of miles away for Proverbs 27:9 describes it thus, &ldquo;A sweet friendship refreshes the soul&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s something very real and refreshing about friendships that family relationships can sometimes lack. &ldquo;You can choose your friends but not your family&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God designed us to need other people to form, inspire, maintain and enjoy good relationships with others. People can be so much more effective, balanced and wiser as a result of developing and maintaining healthy friendships, for scripture says in Proverbs 27:17 A person sharpens the mind and life of it friend, make it more active and vigorous, because conversation promotes intelligence, infects and inspires. For wise and profitable discourse sharpens wits, impact knowledge, even looks, cheers the spirit and put briskness and liveliness into life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scripture says in Daniel 1:1-20 that Daniel and his three friends, Shadrach; Meshach; and Abednego who refused to be defied by the Babylonian king&rsquo;s delicacies and their drinks are good example, because good persons graces, are sharpened by converse with the good, and the bad persons lust and passions, are sharpened by converse with those that are bad, as 2 Samuel 13:1-15 says, David had lovely beautiful daughter Tamar; and son called Amnon. 2 Samuel 13:11 . . . &ldquo;As she was feeding him, he grabbed her and demanded, &ldquo;Come to bed with me.&rdquo; Amnon abominablly and incestuously rapped Tamar her blood sister from the same father, through the friendship, impact and advice of Jonadab, who was a very subtil and shrewd.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As iron is sharpened by its like, by the file, persons are filed, made smooth and bright, and fit for business, who were once rough, dull and inactive. The language of friendship is not words but meanings, action and impact. When the character of a person is not clear to you, look at his friends. Its obvious that friends influences, inspires and imparts and impact that Proverbs 22:24-25 says &ldquo;Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go: Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Friendship is part of God&rsquo;s way of life. His Word says much about friendship. A major underpinning in God&rsquo;s plan is healthy, strong and close relationships. In so much as any one pushes you nearer to God, he or she is your friend. The Scriptures refer to Abraham and Moses as friends of God (Exodus 33:11; James 2:23). Jesus had close friends. Though the disciples were His closest friends, He had friendly relationships with others, including tax collectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Talmud says, &ldquo;A person without a friend or companion is like a left hand without the right&rdquo;. It show examples and advantages of union in human affairs. But, 2 Corinthians 6:14 says, &ldquo;Do not be unequally yoked together with unbelievers&rdquo; . If none of your friends encourages you to obey God and live for God and continue walking in holiness, you have no friend at all. You are to have friends with those who bring you closer to God. We are not to yoke in friendship and acquaintance with friends who do not convert sinners and perfect saints in holiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have been stabbed in the back by those I needed most. Also, I have been lied to, and against by those I love. I have been accused falsely that it made breaking news and headlines by those I blindly called friends. I have been framed up that I find it difficult even to deny while I am innocent by what I thought was a close and a dear friend. I have felt alone, but actually abandoned when I couldn&rsquo;t afford to be, by who I regard as intimate friend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, by all this, I had to learn that a time and season has to come to test and vet the what, quality and genuineness and heart of everyone, anyone regards as or call a friend. Sharing our deepest secrets is a mark of great friendship. Even scripture says in Psalm 25:14 . . . &ldquo;Friendship with the Lord is reserved for those who fear him. With them he shares the secrets of his covenant&rdquo;. When God shares the secrets of his promises with us, we know that he considers us his friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only way to have a friend is to be one. Life is partly what we make it and partly what it is made by the friends we choose. Life without a friend is death without a witness. We are all travelers in the wilderness of this world, and the best we can find in our travels is an honest friend. Friendship multiplies the good of life and divides the evil. Friendship doubles our joy and divides our grief. Friendship makes prosperity more shining and lessens adversity by dividing and sharing it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Real friendship involves face-to-face honesty and loyalty. The strength and sweetness of friendship depend on sincerity tempered by sympathy. There is a vast difference between knowing someone well and being a true friend. The greatest evidence of genuine friendship is loyalty, &quot;always loyal,&rdquo; see 1 Corinthians 13:7, and being available to help in times of distress or personal struggles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hughes said, &ldquo;Blessed are they, who have the gift of making friends, for it is one of God&#39;s best gifts. It involves many things, but above all, the power of going out of one&#39;s self, and appreciating whatever is noble and loving in another&rdquo;. While Johnson said, &ldquo;We cannot tell the precise moment when friendship is formed. As in filling a vessel drop by drop, there is at last a drop that makes it run over, so in a series of kindnesses there is at last one that makes the heart run over&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until friends loved, drawn close, struggles, suffered and linked together there is no sacred bond. There is a magnet in your heart that will attract true friends. That magnet is unselfishness, thinking of others first, when you learn to live for others, they will live for you. A true friend, freely advises justly, assists readily, adventures boldly, takes all patiently, defends courageously and continues a friend unchangeably. Friendship is always an act of recognition, with the creatures we don&rsquo;t share a drop of blood with, yet hold the closest spot in our hearts. Friends are our family outside the closed walls of the house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The batch, logo and key of friendship is what the scripture says in Colossians 3:13 says &quot;Bear with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you.&quot; Because friendship with a person is friendship with its virtue and burden. For every true friend is a destiny partner, hence they find themselves enfolded in all of life affection. Constant friends make the hard times easier and the easy times better. All true friendship are and is, in a sense, covenantal. A true friend is someone who is there for you when he&#39;d rather be anywhere else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Friendship requires honesty, but we also know how to be honest without being open. Real friends don&rsquo;t just know the truth about each other, they know the whole truth. They sometimes see us more clearly than we even see ourselves. The language of friendship is not words but meanings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Friendship is one mind in two bodies. True friendship lasts till death and does not fluctuate from time to time. The essential qualities of good friends are trustworthiness, loyalty and honesty. But friendship is precious, not only in the shade, but in the sunshine of life, and thanks to a benevolent arrangement the greater part of life is sunshine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Good friends enhance the quality, the pleasure, and the health of each other. we choose our friends, not our family, the personal and positive nature of friendship is voluntary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Friendship may, and often does, grow into love and even into marriage, but love never subsides into friendship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most importantly, good friend value our presence in their life, though hard to find, harder to leave and impossible to forget. Research has shown that the better the quality of your relationships, the more likely you are to be happy. So, being a great friend to someone and having friends support your back is good for your wellbeing. A friend is, as it were, a second self.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good friend walks the talk and shows their sincerity and care by their actions, big and small. They are the family we choose! There are friends, there is family, and then there are friends that become family. They give us company when we are lonely, support us unconditionally and accept us despite our shortcomings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Friends help us grow at a spiritual level, as each soul is on a journey. Friends are guides who come into our lives, play their roles in our life. Don&rsquo;t we all have friends who we were very close to us at one point, but with whom we are no longer in touch with now? They drifted away from our life when their role as guide was over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As light shines through transparent objects, real friends can see into our souls. Over time, our friends learn our greatest joys and deepest sorrows. They learn our strongest beliefs, opinions, and fears. They know our most challenging temptations and our most shameful failures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We crack open the doors of our souls to our friends. And when we don&rsquo;t, our friends gently knock because they care enough to see how we&rsquo;re really doing inside. Every one of us needs at least one person who knows us as well as we know ourselves, perhaps even better than we know ourselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>True friends walk in the light together. The apostle John writes, &ldquo;If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin&rdquo; (1 John 1:7). What does it mean to walk in the light? The light is the place of cleansing. Meaning darkness isn&rsquo;t just the place where we disobey; its the place where we hide. But, the light isn&rsquo;t just where we obey, but where we come out of hiding, where we open up about how we&rsquo;ve disobeyed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walking in the light, then, isn&rsquo;t about being perfect; it&rsquo;s about admitting we&rsquo;re not. As we confess our sins to God and others, we find real forgiveness and true fellowship (1:6&ndash;7). True friends speak with straightforward honesty and not in riddles. The English Puritan, Thomas Goodwin, wrote, &ldquo;Simplicity and plain-heartedness is the truest and rarest jewel in friendship.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a friend we speak clearly, but also gently sometimes, and only when necessary, this means delivering hard words. We all need correction from time to time. The best people to give it are our closest friends. Proverbs 27:5&ndash;6 says, &ldquo;Better is open rebuke than hidden love. Faithful are the wounds of a friend; profuse are the kisses of an enemy. A good friend loves enough to give these faithful wounds, and also loves enough to do it kindly&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The anthem of friendship is that your friend rather be disappointed by the truth than be packaged, equipped and satisfied with a lie. Respect your friend, not because it respect you, but because your friend and friendship deserve respect. How pleased, would you be if you found out your friend respected you, only because it wanted you to respect it back or wanted something in return? Respect your friend because it deserve it. Listen to your friend because it deserve to be heard, not because it listens to you. Be nice to your friend because it deserve to be treated right. Care for your friend because its heart needs care. If your thoughts and feelings are not genuine, point them in a direction other than your friend. If I as your friend give you what you deserve, at least keep me away from what I don&rsquo;t deserve.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proverbs 17:17 says, A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity. Empathy is the ability to understand and adjust to someone&rsquo;s emotional state. It is the capacity to enter his mind, to peer out at the world through its eyes. Empathetic friends weep with friends who weep and rejoice with friends who rejoice. We understand how they feel and why they feel it, as we also feel it with them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Empathy shapes the whole tone of a relationship, without it, we trade honoring friends for one-upping them. We trade affirmation for sarcasm. We trade talking with for talking at. We trade listening to sorrows for changing the subject.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over time we learn our friends&rsquo; temperaments, their moods, and their buttons. We know what makes them tick and what ticks them off. This all informs how we relate to them. We pick up on our friend&rsquo;s emotional state and we adapt to it. As we do this, consideration serves as a primary way that we bear our friend&rsquo;s burdens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>True friends keep confidences. We learn the importance of trust when it&rsquo;s not there. One of the characters in the book of Proverbs is &ldquo;the whisperer.&rdquo; Proverbs 16:28 says, &ldquo;A dishonest man spreads strife, and a whisperer separates close friends.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Relationship don&rsquo;t last because of good times, they last because the hard times were handled with the reality, care and service of friendship. The world and life is filled with honest, dedicated and available friends, if you can&rsquo;t find, be one. Don&rsquo;t just have and attend to a friend, but cherish, serve, give, invite, bear engage and participate in the friendship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proverbs 17:9 says, &ldquo;Whoever covers an offense seeks love, but he who repeats a matter separates close friends.&rdquo; The whisperer shares information, whether true or false, that should stay hidden. He wraps it up, labels it as a &ldquo;concern&rdquo; or a &ldquo;prayer request,&rdquo; and delivers it to whomever will hear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proverbs says, beware, because this severs even the closest relationships. Gossip erodes trust, and distrust erodes friendship. It is the opposite of safety. If you suspect that someone may talk about your issues behind your back, you won&rsquo;t share them anymore. Suspicion will tint your lenses when you look at your friend. It will shade how you see every aspect of the relationship. When distrust enters you relationship, you may remain friendly, but you can&rsquo;t remain real friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A South African proverbs says &ldquo;A friend will be sure to act the part of an advocate before he will assume that of a judge&rdquo;. &ldquo;A true friend is the gift of God, and he only who made hearts can unite them&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Friends need to reciprocate every marks. We may want someone to be our friend. We may show them affection, constancy, empathy, and so forth. But if this friend does not share the desire for friendship, it won&rsquo;t happen. Friendship requires mutuality, mutual affection, mutual constancy, and so forth. Christians share common interests with friends as well, but they also unite around the most important thing about them. Friendships are always &ldquo;about something,&rdquo; and Christian friendship is, at its core, about Jesus Christ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People without friends often experience the vulnerability of loneliness, that poignant state that many of us have felt at some point. Friendships are destroyed when boundaries are violated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;A real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out, though hard to find, difficult to leave, and impossible to forget.&rdquo; John O&rsquo;Donohue said that &ldquo;One of the tasks of true friendship is to listen compassionately and creatively to the hidden silences. Often secrets are not revealed in words, they lie concealed in the silence between the words or in the depth of what is unsayable between two people.&rdquo; Titus Maccius Plautus said, &ldquo;Where there are friends, there is wealth.&rdquo; &ldquo;Friends are the siblings God never gave us.&rdquo; &ldquo;A friend is a gift you give yourself.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Philippians 2:3 &quot;Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Friendship consists in forgetting what one gives and remembering what one receives.&rdquo; &ldquo;No person is your friend who demands your silence, or denies your right to grow.&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make friends who are comfortable to be with. Make friends who will force you to lever yourself up.&rdquo; Good friends are like stars. You don&#39;t always see them, but you know they&#39;re always there. An Irish Proverb Says &ldquo;A good friend is like a four-leaf clover: hard to find and lucky to have&rdquo;. It&#39;s not what we have in life, but who we have in our life that matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>True friends are never apart, maybe in distance but never in heart. The only way to have a friend is to be one. One of the most beautiful qualities of true friendship is to understand and to be understood. There is nothing on this earth more to be prized than true friendship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>True friendship can afford true knowledge, as it depend not darkness and ignorance, but the best measures of its worth. A friend is an emotional bond and a human experience. Friendship is two-sided, for it isn&#39;t a friend just because someone is doing something nice for you. That&#39;s a nice person. Its called friendship when you do for each other, just like marriage, its two-sided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is one basic truth, there is some self-interest behind every friendship. There is no friendship without self-interests. Friendship marks a life even more deeply than love. Love risks degenerating into obsession, friendship is never anything but sharing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a bitter truth Epicuru says, &ldquo;Of all the things which wisdom provides to make us entirely happy, much the greatest is the possession of friendship&rdquo;. Never do a wrong thing to make a friend or to keep one. &ldquo;An insincere and evil friend is more to be feared than a wild beast; a wild beast may wound your body, but an evil friend will wound your mind, it&rsquo;s the heart wound that kills.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God&rsquo;s way is not one of total independence from others. It is a way of interdependence of close relationships and of working together as a well-trained team to accomplish the goals He sets before us. All of us need to actively seek, develop and maintain friendships from a godly perspective and motive. We will be better people as a result.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Proverbs 18:24 &ldquo;A man who has friends must himself be friendly, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother&rdquo;. When scripture speaks about showing yourself friendly, it means putting forth effort and first becoming a friend to others!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An important aspect of being a true friend is showing openness honestly to others! A true friend is made by the quality of communication and service, not the amount. One bedrock rule from Proverbs 18:24 is that if you are not willing to attempt to be a friend you will not have friends. If a man do not maintain a friendly carriage, he cannot expect to retain his friends. Friendship is a good plant; but it requires cultivation to make it grow. &quot;In doubtful times the genuine friend is known.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luke 6:3 &quot;Do to others as you would have them do to you.&quot; An example from History, when Solomon stated, &ldquo;A man that has friends must show himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticks closer than a brother,&rdquo; he knew exactly what he was talking about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now over 3,500 years later, the rules of friendship have not changed. The wise ruler understood that even though making and maintaining friendships is a daunting task, it produces companions who are as close, or closer than family. He knew that this wasn&rsquo;t something that happened overnight, but took time and effort. If Solomon was willing to pay the price, how much more should we!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A friend is something which is indeed mutual and a stronger form of interpersonal bond than an association. A friend in need is a friend indeed, its a famous proverb to express the importance of friendships.</p>"}}, {"model": "armyofjesuschrist.latestsermon", "pk": 7, "fields": {"title": "IN FAILURE OR DEFEAT THERE IS A CAUSE!", "by": "Pastor Eric C Okechukwu", "date": "2020-05-26T13:51:50Z", "image": "sermon.jpg", "word": "<p>Introduction</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its amazing that every story in the Bible has lessons for the people of God to learn of present truth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We saw the abundant grace, thrill and bliss of miracles, like River Jordan stop flowing, the walls of Jericho fell, Psalm 114:4 says, &ldquo;The mountains skipped like goats; the hills jumped about like lambs&rdquo;, and the Kingdom of Jericho and it&rsquo;s allied kingdoms were conquered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God provides every avenue to make victory possible. At the same time, also He does not make defeat impossible. As a Christian, why should I say this, because God gave us the freedom of choice. We make choices that can lead to victory or failure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After such a wonderful victorious experience at Jericho, chapter 7 is surprisingly to say the least. We saw failures opposite of God&rsquo;s promises victories to Joshua and the Israelites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joshua 7:5 &ldquo;The men of Ai 5chased the Israelites from the town gate as far as the quarries, and they killed about thirty-six who were retreating down the slope. The Israelites were paralyzed with fear at this turn of events, and their courage melted away&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is the story of life and one we must learn to deal with, in our daily walk because this passage is so typical of most of us Christian today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The distance between victory and defeat is only one step, and often only a short one at that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Canaanites steals, Robb&rsquo;s, practiced the basest forms of immorality including child sacrifice. God had given them over four hundred years to repent, but now their iniquity had become full in Genesis 15:16 &ldquo;It will be four generations before your descendants come back here, because I will not drive out the Amorites until they become so wicked that they must be punished.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is why the Lord God made it more clear in Leviticus 18:24-28 &ldquo;Do not defile yourselves in any of these ways, for the people I am driving out before you have defiled themselves in all these ways. Because the entire land has become defiled, I am punishing the people who live there. I will cause the land to vomit them out. You must obey all my decrees and regulations. You must not commit any of these detestable sins. This applies both to native-born Israelites and to the foreigners living among you. &ldquo;All these detestable activities are practiced by the people of the land where I am taking you, and this is how the land has become defiled. So do not defile the land and give it a reason to vomit you out, as it will vomit out the people who live there now&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The few who did turn to the Lord (Rahab and her family) were spared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joshua 7:1-12 &quot;But Israel violated the instructions about the things set apart for the LORD. A man named Achan had stolen some of these dedicated things, so the LORD was very angry with the Israelites. Achan was the son of Carmi, a descendant of Zimri son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah. 2Joshua sent some of his men from Jericho to spy out the town of Ai, east of Bethel, near Beth-aven. 3... they returned, told Joshua, &ldquo;let only 3,000 warriors be sent, but they were soundly defeated. The men of Ai 5chased the Israelites and killed about thirty-six. The Israelites were paralyzed with fear at this turn of events, and their courage melted away. 6Joshua and the elders of Israel tore their clothing in dismay, threw dust on their heads, and bowed face down to the ground before the Ark of the LORD until evening and cried out, to God...&rdquo; 10But the LORD said to Joshua, &ldquo;Get up! Why are you lying on your face like this? 11Israel has sinned and broken my covenant! They have stolen some of the things that I commanded must be set apart for me. And ... lied about it and hidden the things among their own belongings. 12That is why the Israelites are running from their enemies in defeat. For now Israel itself has been set apart for destruction. I will not remain with you any longer unless you destroy the things among you that were set apart for destruction&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Defeat of Israel by &ldquo;Ai&rdquo; is very important to us today Christian, this is because every defeat of God&#39;s people recorded in the Bible contains lessons for God&#39;s people today like in Romans 15:4 &ldquo;Such things were written in the Scriptures long ago to teach us. And the Scriptures give us hope and encouragement as we wait patiently for God&rsquo;s promises to be fulfilled&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And 1 Corinthians 10:11. &ldquo;These things happened to them as examples for us. They were written down to warn us who live at the end of the age&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is there such a thing as defeat in the life of a Christian? Yes, but it does not have to happen! The Bible tells us that we are involved in spiritual warfare and that Satan is doing everything that he can to defeat us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ephesians 6:12 &ldquo;For we are not fighting against flesh-and-blood enemies, but against evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world, against mighty powers in this dark world, and against evil spirits in the heavenly places&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, defeat should not be part of the normal Christian experience if we follow 1 Peter 5:8 &ldquo;Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Disobedience of Israel is Defined in Joshua 7:1 &ldquo;But the sons of Israel acted unfaithfully in regard to the things under the ban, for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, took some of the things under the ban, therefore the anger of the LORD burned against the sons of Israel&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The believer is in a greater danger of a fall after a victory, when we drop our guard and begin trusting in ourselves or in our past victories rather than the Lord.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One victory never guarantees the next. Only as it builds our confidence in the Lord and develops our wisdom in appropriating God&rsquo;s Word do our victories aid us for the next battle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1 Corinthians 10:12 it says, &ldquo;The sons of Israel acted unfaithfully in regard &hellip;&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s note this problem facing the Israelites as a nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The word &ldquo;unfaithfully&rdquo; means &ldquo;to act underhandedly or infidelity.&rdquo; The sin as every sin was and is both an act of spiritual infidelity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was sin in the camp and God would not continue blessing the nation as long as this was so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This does not mean this was the only sin and the rest of the nation was sinless, but this sin was of such a nature that God used it to teach Israel and us a couple of important lessons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God viewed the nation of Israel as a unit. What one did was viewed as a sin for the whole nation because Israel&rsquo;s corporate life illustrates truth and warnings for us as individuals (1 Cor. 10).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Achan&rsquo;s behavior also illustrates how one or a few believers out of fellowship, when pursuing their own selfish desires and agendas, can negatively impact an entire group. Such behavior can create trouble for the rest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God and get defiled and immoral or godless like Esau, who sold his own birthright for a single meal&rdquo; in Hebrews 12:15-16.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump of dough? Clean out the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, just as you are in fact unleavened. For Christ our Passover also has been sacrificed&rdquo; (1 Corinthians 5:6-7).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1 Corinthians 5:6 Unjudged sin contaminated the whole assembly, &rdquo;Don&rsquo;t you know that a little yeast works through the whole batch of dough?&rdquo; (v. 6).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hiding our sin can only hinders our progress in God&rsquo;s will and plan Proverbs 28:13 &ldquo;People who conceal their sins will not prosper, but if they confess and turn from them, they will receive mercy&rdquo;, and creates trouble for others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Numbers 32:23 reminds us, &ldquo;be sure your sin will find you out.&rdquo; This is similar to the idea of reaping what we sow because of the natural consequences of God&rsquo;s spiritual and moral laws and because of God&rsquo;s personal involvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Numbers teaches us that sin will not only be discovered but that the consequences of our sin become active agents in discovering us and Galatians 6:7-8 &ldquo;7Don&rsquo;t be misled&mdash;you cannot mock the justice of God. You will always harvest what you plant. 8Those who live only to satisfy their own sinful nature will harvest decay and death from that sinful nature. But those who live to please the Spirit will harvest everlasting life from the Spirit&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sin is no small matter with God because sin is rebellion and rebellion is as the sin of divination in 1 Sam. 15:23.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though Christ died for our sins and stands at God&rsquo;s right hand as our Advocate and Intercessor, God does not and cannot treat sin in our lives lightly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sin is against God&rsquo;s holy character, and against His holy purposes for us. Sin hinders God control and ability to lead us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The defeat of Israel&rsquo;s army at Ai was embarrassing, because Ai was smaller than Jericho! How could such a defeat occur so quickly? The root cause, as summarized in verse one, was the sin of Achan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is one of the varying consequences of sin in the life of God&rsquo;s people or in the life of the individual. Sin has many consequences, none of them good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joshua evidently failed to take time to get alone with the Lord to inquire of Him and seek His strength. If he had, he would not have remained ignorant of the sin of Achan and could have dealt with it first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Four deadly errors were the result:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. They remained ignorant of the sin of Achan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. They underestimated the strength of the enemy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>c. They over-estimated the strength of their own army.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>d. They presumed on the Lord, they took Him for granted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&#39;s look at the REASONS why Ai DEFEATED Israel!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. The first reason is given to us in the first verse of chapter 7. Israel disobeyed the Lord. How? God had explicitly told His people (6:17-19) that when they conquered Jericho they were not to take any of the spoils of Jericho for themselves. But we read (7:1, 21) that a man named Achan stole some of the silver and gold which was to go into the treasury of the Lord and hid it under his tent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Achan thought his little stealing means nothing and would not affect the treasury of the Lord or the welfare of the people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But God saw it differently! Achan&#39;s sin of disobedience was the primary reason for the defeat of all Israel at Ai. God emphasizes this fact in His Word by stating it twice--both before (7:1) and after the defeat (7:11).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think of it, not only did Achan&#39;s sin result in the defeat of Isreal by Ai, but God declared (7:12) that the whole nation could not move forward and that the whole nation would not have the Lord&#39;s help and presence unless the sin was judged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember, this is all because of one man&#39;s secret sin. Check out verse 21 again and notice the snowballing effect. &quot;...I saw ... I coveted ... I took ...&quot; Little did Achan realize that his personal and private sin would affect all Israel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What about our secret sins? Are you an Achan? Is the spiritual growth and progress of the group with whom you fellowship stifled because of your sin?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is the presence of the Lord and help from the Lord limited, or hindered, within your marriage, family, or the church or Bible study you attend because of your personal and private sins?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are heavy and maybe disturbing concepts, but they are Scriptural. God sees the fellowship as a whole. We cannot sin in a vacuum. We are not &quot;islands unto ourselves&quot;. Like Achan, we don&#39;t begin to see the far-reaching effects and consequences of our selfish sins until it is too late.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Achan&#39;s sin was not that he robbed Jericho or even his own people; he robbed God. Do we rob God? We can rob God by wasting time, because it is His time. The same could be said in reference to the abilities that God has given us, as well as our material possessions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of our time, talent and treasure belongs to the treasury of the Lord. The idea that only a certain percentage is the Lord&#39;s and the rest is ours to use or abuse in any way we choose is foreign to the Scriptures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are robbing God when we fritter away our time watching &quot;nothing&quot; but TV. We are guilty of robbing the treasury of the Lord whenever we use our natural talents or acquired skills (as well as our money) to do things which are not pleasing to the Lord.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes the Lord&#39;s treasury is ripped off in the name of hobbies, or extracurricular activities, or &quot;rest and relaxation&quot;-when such good things are carried too far.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God would teach us from Joshua 7 that such robbery is not only sinful, but it leads to spiritual defeat in our own lives and detrimental effects on the spiritual growth of our brothers and sisters in the Lord.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Are we guilty of this sin? Are we defeated, and causing defeat in the lives of fellow believers, because we have robbed God of what rightfully belongs to Him?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Another reason for Israel&#39;s defeat at Ai was overconfidence. We see in verse 3 that Israel was so self-confident that they figured only two or three thousand men were needed to conquer Ai. How wrong they were! We see from Joshua 8:25 that their estimate of the enemy&#39;s strength was much too low.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overconfidence will do this every time. Fear will make the enemy appear larger, but overconfidence will make the enemy appear smaller. Both extremes are wrong for the Christian warrior. We are not to cringe in fear before Satan and we are not to think we can fight him in our own strength. Our confidence must be in the Lord as the Bible says in Ephesians 6:10 &quot;Be strong in the Lord, and in the strength of His might&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We growing Christians are particularly vulnerable to the problem of overconfidence right after a spiritual victory. That&#39;s the way it was at Ai. Israel had just won a major victory at Jericho. They were still on a &quot;spiritual high&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another reason of Israel&#39;s is that there&rsquo;s was no communication with the Lord. We do not read of Joshua and the elders of Israel coming to the Lord in prayer until after the defeat (7:6-9). No wonder the Lord told Joshua to get up off his knees (7:10). There was no need to ask God why Israel was defeated (7:7).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God had clearly promised continuous victory to Israel if they would obey Him in Joshua 1:7-8 &ldquo;7Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the instructions Moses gave you. Do not deviate from them, turning either to the right or to the left. Then you will be successful in everything you do. 8Study this Book of Instruction continually. Meditate on it day and night so you will be sure to obey everything written in it. Only then will you prosper and succeed in all you do&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continual communication with the Lord is essential for growing Christians. Many casualties of spiritual warfare would be eliminated if we would fall to our knees before the battle-not after we&#39;ve experienced defeat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Israel&#39;s sin had to be dealt with decisively. The fact that Achan&#39;s family was stoned and burned along with Achan (7:24) may seem like a rather harsh judgment, but it is probably a good indication that the family was also guilty. After all, it would have been pretty hard to bury the treasure inside the home tent (7:21) without the family being &quot;in on it&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any case, the lesson for us is pointed. We must deal ruthlessly with that which brings defeat in our lives-before it brings further defeat!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is materialism bringing defeat in your Christian life? Then give away your material! Do you have a problem with unhealthy literature or art? Then don&#39;t buy or read or scan or browse or &quot;peek at&quot; unhealthy paperbacks or magazines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is what our Lord meant in Matthew 18:8-9 &ldquo;8So if your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It&rsquo;s better to enter eternal life with only one hand or one foot than to be thrown into eternal fire with both of your hands and feet. 9And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It&rsquo;s better to enter eternal life with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Israel passed in review before the Lord (7:13-18), so we should examine ourselves in His presence and let His Word point out those &quot;troublers&quot; in our lives that are causing defeat. Also, Psalm 139:23-24says, &ldquo;23Search me, O God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. 24Point out anything in me that offends you, and lead me along the path of everlasting life&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hebrews 4:12 &ldquo;For the word of God is alive and powerful. It is sharper than the sharpest two-edged sword, cutting between soul and spirit, between joint and marrow. It exposes our innermost thoughts and desires&rdquo;.</p>"}}, {"model": "armyofjesuschrist.latestsermon", "pk": 8, "fields": {"title": "The World Won\u2019t Come To An End!", "by": "Pastor Eric C Okechukwu", "date": "2020-05-26T13:54:12Z", "image": "sermons_pic/90561326_2493347087594837_7740836157629399040_n.jpg", "word": "<p>Are you scared that the world is coming to an end? No &hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The First Quarantine</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Adriatic port city of Ragusa (modern-day Dubrovnik) was the first to pass legislation requiring the mandatory quarantine of all incoming ships and trade caravans in order to screen for infection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The order, which miraculously survived in the Dubrovnik archives, reads that on July 27, 1377, the city&rsquo;s Major Council passed a law &ldquo;which stipulates that those who come from plague-infested areas shall not enter [Ragusa] or its district unless they spend a month on the islet of Mrkan or in the town of Cavtat, for the purpose of disinfection.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mrkan was an uninhabited rocky island south of the city and Cavtat was situated at the end of the caravan road used by overland traders en route to Ragusa, writes Zlata Blazina Tomic in Expelling the Plague: The Health Office and the Implementation of Quarantine in Dubrovnik, 1377-1533.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By ordering the isolation of healthy sailors and traders for 30 days, Ragusan officials showed a remarkable understanding of incubation periods. New arrivals might not have exhibited symptoms of the plague, but they would be held long enough to determine if they were in fact disease-free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 430 B.C., Athens, the earliest recorded pandemic happened during the Peloponnesian War. The disease passed through Libya, Ethiopia, Egypt and entered Athenian, two-thirds of the population died. The disease weakened the Athenians significantly and was one factor in their defeat by the Spartans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, in 165 A.D., Antonine Plague began with the Huns. They infected the Germans, who passed it to the Romans and then returning troops spread it throughout the Roman empire. This plague killed millions, and continued until about 180 A.D., claiming Emperor Marcus Aurelius as one of its victims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, in 250 A.D., Cyprian Plague</p>\r\n\r\n<p>named after the first known victim, the Christian bishop of Carthage. It starting in Ethiopia, it passed through Northern Africa, into Rome, then onto Egypt and northward. In 444 A.D., it hit Britain and obstructed defense efforts against the Picts and the Scots, causing the British to seek help from the Saxons, who would soon control the island.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, in 541 A.D., Justinian Plague first appearing in Egypt, the Justinian plague spread through Palestine and the Byzantine Empire, and then throughout the Mediterranean. It</p>\r\n\r\n<p>killed about 50 million people, 26 percent of the world population. Its believed to be the first significant appearance of the bubonic plague, which features enlarged lymphatic gland and is carried by rats and spread by fleas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, in 1350 The Black Death responsible for the death of one-third of the world population. It started in Asia, moved west in caravans, entering through Sicily in 1347 A.D. when plague sufferers arrived in the port of Messina, it spread throughout Europe rapidly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>England and France were so incapacitated by the plague that the countries called a truce to their war. The British feudal system collapsed when the plague changed economic circumstances and demographics. Ravaging populations in Greenland, Vikings lost the strength to wage battle against native populations, and their exploration of North America halted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, in 1492, The Columbian Exchange. Following the arrival of the Spanish in the Caribbean, passed along to the native populations by the Europeans. With no previous exposure, these diseases devastated indigenous people, with as many as 90 percent dying throughout the north and south continents. Upon arrival on the island of Hispaniola, Christopher Columbus encountered the Taino people, population 60,000. By 1548, the population stood at less than 500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, in 1520, the Aztec Empire was destroyed by a smallpox infection. The disease killed many of its victims, incapacitated others and weakened the population so they were unable to resist Spanish colonizers and left farmers unable to produce needed crops.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Above apart, in 1665, The Great Plague of LondonFrom 1665 and 1666, the plague led to the deaths of 20 percent of London&rsquo;s population.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More so, in 1817, First Cholera Pandemic infection originated in Russia, where one million people died. Spreading to British soldiers who brought it to India where millions more died. The reach of the British Empire and its navy spread it to Spain, Africa, Indonesia, China, Japan, Italy, Germany and America, where it killed 150,000 people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, in 1855, The Third Plague Pandemic starting in China, moving to India and Hong Kong, the plague claimed 15 million victims.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, in 1875: Fiji Measles PandemicCame, after, a royal party visited Australia as a gift from Queen Victoria. The royal party brought the disease and it was spread further by the tribal heads and police who met with them upon their return.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The island was littered with corpses that were scavenged by wild animals, and entire villages died and were burned down, sometimes with the sick trapped inside the fires. One-third of Fiji&rsquo;s population, a total of 40,000 people, died.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, in 1889 Russian Flu</p>\r\n\r\n<p>started in Siberia and Kazakhstan, traveled to Moscow, into Finland, Poland, and moved into the rest of Europe. By the following year, it had crossed the ocean into North America and Africa. By the end of 1890, 360,000 had died.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1918, Spanish Flu that resulted in 50 million deaths worldwide. It was first observed in Europe, the United States and parts of Asia before swiftly spreading around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is said that during that plague, the living spent most of their time hurrying the dead in mass graves and yet others were left unburied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1957, Asian flu starting in Hong Kong to China and then into the United States, the Asian flu became widespread in England where, over six months, 14,000 people died. A second wave followed in early 1958, causing an estimated total of about 1.1 million deaths globally, with 116,000 deaths in the United States alone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1981, HIV/AIDS, First identified in 1981. First observed in American gay communities. AIDS has killed over 35 million people worldwide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2003, SARS Was first identified, started from China, followed by 26 other countries, infecting 8,096 people, with 774 deaths. Quarantine efforts proved effective, the virus was contained and hasn&rsquo;t reappeared since.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2019, COVID-19 Started from Wuhan, in China&#39;s central Hubei province. The first reported case in China appeared November 17, 2019, in the Hubei Province, but went unrecognized. Eight more cases appeared in December with researchers pointing to an unknown virus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many learned about COVID-19-19 when ophthalmologist Dr. Li Wenliang defied government orders and released safety information to other doctors. The following day, China informed WHO and charged Li with a crime. Li died from COVID-19 just over a month later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without a vaccine available, the virus spread beyond Chinese borders and by mid-March, it had spread globally to more than 163 countries. On February 11, the infection was officially christened COVID-19.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By today, corona death is not close to half a million, no.

Day and night He is there waiting for you!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Knowledge takes you far, but understanding takes you further; far beyond knowledge can. But, revelation brings to you the depth, breadth and length of God&rsquo;s word, will and purpose. It opens your eyes to the deep things of God.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, it is necessary to have a clear understanding and deep revelation of the HOLY COMMUNION, and its healing VIRTUES and impact in our lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Holy Communion is a meal, and you know, what goes into a man determines the life that is in him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New King James Version John 6:48,50-51,53-56,58 &quot;I am the bread of life. This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that one may eat of it and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever; and the bread that I shall give is My flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world.&rdquo; Then Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Most assuredly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in you. Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For My flesh is food indeed, and My blood is drink indeed. He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him. ... He who eats this bread will live forever.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your faith and belief is important, because faith makes spiritual sense to receive a miracle. God work in our life through faith.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Holy Communion represents the greatest expression of God&rsquo;s love for His people. It can change your life. Jesus instituted the communion in the church to be a usual continuous practice. Through this meal you can be reached by the healing power and be healed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two items are used in the Holy Communion, the bread which represents Jesus&rsquo; body that was scourged and broken before and during His crucifixion, and the cup which represents His shed blood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God said, &lsquo;I will bring you Health and Cure&rsquo;, and has given us a powerful gift so that none of us would be sick, weak, or die young. The Scripture reveals how you can break free from the curse or spell of sickness through the Holy Communion!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In John 6:48-54 &ldquo;Jesus says I am the bread of life; if you eat of this bread you will live forever&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;The Lords Supper is a personal fellowship with Christ. But, partaking of one bread creates fellowship between the members too; it merges them into one body, the church&quot; The church is the many-membered body of Christ. It is not a building; it is made up of believers coming together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bible calls us &ldquo;living stones&rdquo; in 1 Pet. 2:5 &lsquo;you also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stones that lie scattered on the ground are common, but once they are used to build a house, they become &ldquo;living stones.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are also like &ldquo;living water&rdquo;, not stagnant water. We are meant to be constantly flowing and moving. The Bible describes the Spirit as &ldquo;rivers of living water&rdquo; in John 7:38 &ldquo;He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jesus said, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.&rdquo;&rdquo; John 7:37&ndash;38 NKJV</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every focus of CHRISTIANITY in preaching or teaching or other wise should be on Jesus Himself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our Lord Jesus Christ once said, &ldquo;Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you. Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life&rdquo;&hellip;(John 6:53-56).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The greatest enemy of the believer is spiritual ignorance, not the devil, which has its cure in spiritual revelation. Every provision in the scriptures is only accessible by revelation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In John 11:25, &ldquo;Jesus said to her, &quot;I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holy Communion is one of the mysteries of the Kingdom. We operate by God&rsquo;s Spirit who leads us in the mysterious grace of God. The Scripture says in Luke 8:9-10 9 &ldquo;Then His disciples asked Him, saying, &ldquo;What does this parable mean?&rdquo; 10 And He said, &ldquo;To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, ...&rdquo;.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Holy Communion is a powerful gift that God has given us for there is supernatural power when you take it. Communion brings connection, as it focuses our hearts and minds of God and brings us into complete unity with Him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we take communion, we are recognizing the power of what Jesus did when He died on the cross. We are acknowledging His supernatural work and honoring who He is in our lives. We are saying, &quot;I believe&quot; with our actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More and more, Pastors is receiving testimonies from people who received their healing because of the Holy Communion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you know that when one partook of the Communion, the presence of Jesus was &quot;underneath&quot; the bread and the cup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jesus is the Bread of Life. It is an anti-death, anti-barrenness, anti-miscarriages, anti-hard luck, anti-bewitchment, anti-unfavourable records, anti-evil ordinances, anti-ill/bad luck, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we partake of it, whatever is dying or dead in us is completely healed and restored. It is a &lsquo;global Bread,&rsquo; with global impact; it works anywhere on earth (John 6:52 &ldquo;How can this Man give us Hisflesh to eat?&rdquo;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we partake of the Communion in faith,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>we are empowered to live like Jesus sickness-free, sin-free and mentally sound like Him (John 6:57; Galatians 2:20).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Communion is the Rod of God: Jesus is not only the Son of God; He is also the Rod of God (Isaiah 11:1 There shall come forth a Rod from the stem of Jesse, And a Branch shall grow out of his roots).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jesus is the Rod that came out of the stem of Jesse with the seven Spirits of God upon Him (Revelation 4:5; 5:6).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Exodus 7:10-14, Moses took the Rod of God and went to Egypt. When the Rod was cast down, it became a serpent and swallowed up the rods of the sorcerers and magicians of Egypt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, inside the Flesh is the Rod. When we take it in, it swallows the rods of the magicians (sickness and affliction).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, whenever you take the Communion, imagine yourself taking the Rod, that is, Jesus. As you take it, not one serpent of the magicians, wise men or sorcerers in your body will escape its power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a Miracle Meal that neutralizes every poison in your Body: When eaten, every defiled part of our body is restored (2 Kings 4:40-41).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Flesh of Jesus is the Miracle Meal that goes into our &lsquo;biological pot&rsquo; (stomach) with its unlimited power and neutralizes every poison there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondly, What is in the Blood? The Life of the Flesh: Every disease is traced to the blood,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>because the life of the flesh is in the blood (Leviticus 17:11).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we partake of the Blood of Jesus, there is a spiritual blood transfusion that ejects our defiled blood in exchange for His undefiled and incorruptible Blood. Therefore, whatever cannot be traced to His Blood disappears from our body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Conquering Power of God manifests when we partake of the Blood of Jesus, every evil spirit waging war against our health is crushed (Revelation 12:11).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the Blood of Jesus gives us victory and restores our health in a double fashion (Zechariah 9:11-12 &quot;11 As for you also,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because of the blood of your covenant,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I will set your prisoners free from the waterless pit. 12Return to the stronghold, You prisoners of hope. even today I declare that I will restore double to you&quot;).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Communion is God&rsquo;s method for dealing with every sickness of the spirit, soul and body. It is more than just a symbol of Jesus&rsquo; body and blood</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the book of Mark says &ldquo;And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them and said, &ldquo;Take, eat; this is My body.&rdquo; Then He took the cup, and when He had given thanks He gave it to them, and they all drank from it. And He said to them, &ldquo;This is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many.&rdquo; \u202d\u202dMark\u202c \u202d14:22&ndash;24\u202c \u202dNKJV\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c\u202c</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This account tells us that the disciples drank from the cup first, and then Jesus said, &ldquo;This is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many.&rdquo; This tells us that when you partake of the Communion, the bread and juice becomes holy and uncommon, in your body,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jesus&rsquo; body broken for your health and Jesus&rsquo; blood shed for the remission of your sins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You don&rsquo;t need to have &ldquo;great faith&rdquo; to partake of the Communion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Holy Communion is the substance of the Pass Over in the Old Testament. In the Old Testament, their Communion was the Passover Lamb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the night of the Passover in Exodus 12, God told the children of Israel to take a lamb for every household. They were to eat the lamb roasted with fire (symbolizing Jesus on the cross).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the Israelites ate the roasted lamb, judgment was happening outside their houses. The Angel of Death was going around killing the firstborn child of everyone who did not have the blood of the lamb on their doorposts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God does not require great faith for you to eat. He only requires hunger and obedience to eat what He gives you. Even if some Israelites didn&rsquo;t have faith, even if they were crying and afraid in their homes, as long as the blood of the lamb was on their doorpost, they were saved. Their security lay in the blood, not in their faith.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, even if the Egyptians were calm and had a &ldquo;positive mindset,&rdquo; they would have still died if they didn&rsquo;t have the blood of the lamb on their doorpost. It&rsquo;s not about positive thinking, it&rsquo;s about the blood. Without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness of sins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jesus died for you. His blood has been shed for the remission of your sins. Partake in the Holy Communion by being conscious of the truth that its Gods grace and previous for divine healing, empowerment and restoration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Holy Communion is so important that God personally revealed it to Paul and he said</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you: that the Lord Jesus on the same night in which He was betrayed took bread; and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, &ldquo;Take, eat; this is My body which is broken for you; do this in remembrance of Me.&rdquo; In the same manner He also took the cup after supper, saying, &ldquo;This cup is the new covenant in My blood...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To read more go to <a href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.siftersnews.com%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1KIdO7diFchotOvuDCM5zlGpULMWNTg3ly13y26Yvx0b1AVjFo469tt7c&amp;h=AT3rPSRtV2nqnV3JquCit9TNyu1p5s5lRxvrwC8ZY3F4THPdmaOA6mCbF7fJbOo6BGiTd62FyYmuJ59fwCJ2gQbtiPeCzT60QkGPAHvXKhkLdfG18P3IwiI-CEE1MsHogauS&amp;__tn__=-UK-R&amp;c[0]=AT0lblJtMZFsX5VZMKv8xTmkWyd2gKJ01QZp51cSfIs9TE-lqL9UTULHtHPthBubs7qUpWqXWYzbKBA3JJJcRxSRvrpC4chce0gqJx19DwZJfLdEFaBPeCktCGEtzYnBLtRztAGpEZ1deaYtTruFPXiYj4H1-luIlUEcak2C306zZuR6eUG26M4-qUY\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" tabindex=\"0\" target=\"_blank\">www.siftersnews.com</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without a revelation of the Communion, &ldquo;many are weak and sick among you, and many sleep.&rdquo; The Lord watches over this revelation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to Him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God wants you healthy. God wants you strong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God wants you to live a full life. The Communion is more powerful than you realize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When a Gentile woman came to Jesus for healing for her demon-possessed daughter, Jesus told her that healing is the &ldquo;children&rsquo;s bread.&rdquo; The woman replied, &ldquo;... even the little dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters&rsquo; table.&rdquo; And Jesus healed her daughter (see Matt. 15:22&ndash;28).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, if the crumbs can drive a demon out,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>you, child of God, don&rsquo;t just have a crumb.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You have the whole piece of bread. The mysterious extraordinary power of the bread and the cup is much and divine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God is not asking for more than what is in your hand. You can simply use crackers, bread, and grape win, ordinary juice, wine or whatever you have that can symbolize the body and blood of Jesus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&#39;s not the elements that hold the power; it&#39;s your faith in Jesus and your surrender to Jesus. It&#39;s your obedience to His Word that says, &quot;Do this in remembrance of Me.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Honour the Lord through communion. Open your heart to Him and discover the blessing of fellowshipping with our heavenly Father in such a personal way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Holy Communion might be small, but it is mighty. It is so powerful that the devil is terrified of it. It is God&rsquo;s provision for us so that we don&rsquo;t have to suffer the sickness and death that the world is suffering.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God is saying, &ldquo;I have given you a provision&mdash;the body and blood of my Son. If you would partake of it, you will escape the condemnation and sentence on the world.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a sentence on this world because of sin: sickness and death. Christians are not to suffer that sentence because Jesus&rsquo; blood was shed for the remission of our sins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To read more go to <a href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.siftersnews.com%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR1qyfNkTKmI5DY_nOjqereWXlUgVpjRPidyrtGl1MZ9MUeHgDaDHQd42X0&amp;h=AT3rPSRtV2nqnV3JquCit9TNyu1p5s5lRxvrwC8ZY3F4THPdmaOA6mCbF7fJbOo6BGiTd62FyYmuJ59fwCJ2gQbtiPeCzT60QkGPAHvXKhkLdfG18P3IwiI-CEE1MsHogauS&amp;__tn__=-UK-R&amp;c[0]=AT0lblJtMZFsX5VZMKv8xTmkWyd2gKJ01QZp51cSfIs9TE-lqL9UTULHtHPthBubs7qUpWqXWYzbKBA3JJJcRxSRvrpC4chce0gqJx19DwZJfLdEFaBPeCktCGEtzYnBLtRztAGpEZ1deaYtTruFPXiYj4H1-luIlUEcak2C306zZuR6eUG26M4-qUY\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" tabindex=\"0\" target=\"_blank\">www.siftersnews.com</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number one thing Jesus did besides preaching is healing all who were sick.

God is the source of inspiration, therefore, we need Him to rule us and our world. It takes inspired mind to enjoy inspired revelations. In the kingdom, life is either of grace or disgrace, and inspiration is a bye product of God&rsquo;s grace. The Scripture says in Job 32:8 &ldquo;But there is a spirit in man but the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inspiration is a phenomenal mystery that only God can explain. The Holy Spirit is the source of Inspiration. It takes a life in God to hear God and live in God. Inspiration is God telling you what the scriptures say so that you can understand them, and who and what you are in life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the kingdom, destiny is built and manifested on the platform of inspiration. If you are not inspired you will not be magnified to manifest, but expire. Expired product does not have value in the store shelve. When you lack inspiration you will not be amplified to attract relevance. If you are not inspired to live your life in the principles of God, you may expire quickly on earth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through this LENT season, things happen in the kingdom by inspiration, not by human wisdom. Yes, we have God&rsquo;s sense, not traditional, none world or worldly sense. We live in God&rsquo;s sense, mercies and grace. It takes knowledge of God&rsquo;s sense, mercies and grace to live in good and bad times of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It takes God&rsquo;s sense and grace to read beyond the lines of traditional and worldly values. Worldliness makes you rate yourself above value and above others, but God inspires your real worth, rate and value. Inspiration is born out of God&rsquo;s persistent consciousness in the soul of man. Only God&rsquo;s presence can revive the mind and make it active and creative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Scriptures says in Psalm 119:105 &ldquo;Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path&rdquo;. It takes the light of God&rsquo;s word in the mind to walk with God on earth. Your mind must first be inspired before your life can aspire for the next level. God is inspired by the righteous act of the righteous to inspire it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can only have a better life by inspirational revelation of God. The secret of your life is based on what you do with the divine instructions you received from God.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Scripture says in Psalm 119:11 &ldquo;Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.&rdquo; A soul is a faculty of reasoning and reasoning is a function of information. Whatever you give your soul to receive, store and believe, will influence the destination of your thought and life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is why our academic excellence does not qualify us as citizens of heaven. Mathematical formulas, economic postulates, accounting and legal principles cannot qualify us for heavenly revelation and inspiration. They can only influence our reasoning after we have met Christ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Abraham heard God and was inspired, and in obedience made generational history. Gideon was inspired and began to do unusual things on earth during a difficult time. God saw it, noticed him and commissioned him. Solomon embarrassed God with unequal sacrificial seed sowing and God inspired and crowned him with phenomenal wisdom, knowledge and insight and wealth beyond the reasons, thought, imagination and comprehension of earthly being till this day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Scripture says in John 6:2-3 KJV &ldquo;And a great multitude followed Him, because they saw His miracles which He did on them that were diseased. And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there He sat with His disciples&rdquo;. The ministry of Jesus is anchored on inspiration. I call it God&rsquo;s sense in a mortal man. It means reasoning beyond the natural phenomenon. Often going to the mountain for divine inspiration, to make impart and impart life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inspiration could mean reasoning beyond the natural phenomenon. Inspiration is an act of the mind, touched and empowered by divine grace. It is the mind of God sown into your spirit that enhances and magnify the value of your performance and confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dearly beloved, it takes inspiration to remain relevant and make impart on your world. Holy words make Holy men. Inspiration is enhanced by holy living. Get involved in Lent fasting and prayers, it is an opportunity to be inspired and be transfotmed. It takes God in the mind of man to be inspired by the Spirit of God.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This season is the eve of Easter. The position attracts good values and divine visitation. This season of &ldquo;LENT&rdquo; fasting and prayer is designed to inspire you and cause great transformation in life situation. The Holy Spirit is the inspirator. He is the within and the anointing upon spoken of by Jesus in John 14:17 &ldquo;Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it sees him not, neither knows him: but you know him; for he dwelles with you, and shall be in you&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It convicts the mind and reveals God&rsquo;s authority and values. It enforces and inspires divine order in the conscience of men. Allow what you believe to inspire your mind to attract what you desire and deserve. Work on your heart and make it stabilized so that God can get involved in your dreams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every dream that ignores God is a comedy, like an African comedy. The company you keep will influence what you believe, what you do, where you go, what you see and hear and what inspires you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inspiration develops by hearing inspired words and by practicing them. Success and failure are by-products of the mind. To live for God is a decision to succeed and be inspired. What you are withdrawing from will determine what you are drawing to. Inspiration is a by-product of covenant decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prophetic words are covenant tools that turn situations around. In this LENT season, open up your heart and the power and grace of God will inspire your destiny forward. The</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scripture says in Proverbs 11:24-2 &ldquo;There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth: and there is that that with holdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty. The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kingdom life must be live by inspiration, even the Scripture is the basis for inspiration. Resourceful labour that must yield harvest must be inspired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Believe God, you will find life more interesting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thanks and God bless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yours in His service!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pastor Eric C. Okechukwu</p>"}}, {"model": "armyofjesuschrist.latestsermon", "pk": 11, "fields": {"title": "A NEW YEAR  AND NEW BEGINNING", "by": "Pastor Eric C Okechukwu", "date": "2020-05-26T13:57:09Z", "image": "sermons_pic/81201496_2429503257312554_147057841969037312_n.jpg", "word": "<p>New is the YEAR, new are the hopes and aspirations, new is the RESOLUTION, new are the SPIRITS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The newness of the year inspires to a great height, for all great things have begun anew.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New Year means new dreams, new beginning, new chances and new feelings. May this be a New Year of new hope, new opportunities, new adventures, and new ways to give and love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happy New Year! This is the first Sunday of this New Year! The holidays are over, the family and friends have gone home, the Christmas presents have been opened, and now its time to go back to work and school!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One major concern is the New Year resolutions we make and then so quickly break. We told ourselves, next year I&rsquo;m going to be more active in church. Next year I&rsquo;m going to get my finances in order. Next year I&rsquo;m going to get into better shape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God offers us more hope than that. In 2 Cor. 5:17, it says, &ldquo;Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old has gone, the new has come!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also Phil. 4:13 advice us, &ldquo;I can do everything through him who gives me strength.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we approach this New Year, I want us to be praying a prayer of thanksgiving, &ldquo;Thank you, Lord, for fresh starts.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new calendar tells us that we have been given a fresh gift to build and change our lives. Every New Year and every New Day is an opportunity to get it &ldquo;righter&rdquo; than the day before and the year before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So on this first Sunday of the New Year, I want to encourage us to make a commitment to focus more on spiritual things in this New Year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Scripture in Col. 3:1-3 says, &ldquo;Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your hearts on things above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things. For you died, and your life is now hidden with Christ in God.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those of us who are Christians have experienced both a spiritual death, and a spiritual birth. All of our hopes and dreams, purpose and power are centered in Christ, who is seated at the right hand of God.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our focus and priorities must no longer be centered in the things of this earth, but on the things of God.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This, of course, is a very real challenge, because we still have to live in the real world, with all of its stress and struggle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Focusing on spiritual things does not remove the stress and struggle altogether, but it certainly makes a huge difference in our ability to both survive and thrive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we try to live a more spiritually focused life in the New Year, I want to point us toward 7 practical priorities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First Priority- Forget About Yesterday. In Phil. 3:13-14 it says, &ldquo;But one thing I do Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we know, Paul was a man who had some things from his past that could haunt him if he let them. He had made some terrible mistakes that brought great suffering to others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is not one of us who doesn&rsquo;t have something negative in our past that could immobilize us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Failures, hurts, disappointments, etc., happen to all of us. But God does not want us dwelling on them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God would have us come to him for forgiveness and healing about the pain and regret of yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is God&rsquo;s gift to us that we can walk in newness of life, that we can forget those things in the past and live in the present. So that&rsquo;s a good place for us to start the New Year, to forget about yesterday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second Priority - Don&rsquo;t Worry about Tomorrow. I know that this is easier said than done. Tomorrow can be so overwhelming with the potential for pain, lack and insufficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jesus gave us prescription in Mt. 6:25-27, 32-34 &ldquo;Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?...So do not worry, saying, &lsquo;What shall we eat?&rsquo; or &lsquo;What shall we drink?&rsquo; or &lsquo;What shall we wear?&rsquo; For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jesus&rsquo; promise is that God knows what we need, and that God will provide what we need. Our job, however difficult it might be, is to trust and obey God.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seek first His kingdom. In other words, stay faithful in obedience and pray. The Scripture says in Phil. 4:6-7, &ldquo;Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to pretend that any of this is easy, but I am certain that there is no better way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Corrie Ten Boom, who had suffered greatly in her life said, &ldquo;Worry does not empty tomorrow of sorrows; but it empties today of strength.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our only hope and help is in trusting in the Lord. Whatever we face in this New Year, we will be better off if we make it a priority to forget the past, and not worry about the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Third Priority - Make Today Count.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The famous funny man, Groucho Marx, said, &ldquo;Yesterday is gone - tomorrow isn&rsquo;t here yet. I have just one day &ndash; today, and I can choose how I shall be! And I choose to be happy!!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The only day we have and the only moment we have is now. We are not promised tomorrow, nor even the rest of today!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For Psalm 118:24 says, &ldquo;This is the day the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we try to take life one day at a time, and make each day count, we can do so by walking with the Lord.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can thank God and rejoice in each day and ask God to guide us and help us make each day count.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Focusing on one day at a time frees us from the burden of the past, and the worry of the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fourth Priority - Help Every Person You Can.When we focus all our attention on ourselves, we get lost in our struggles, but when we turn our attention outward, we realize the tremendous blessing of helping others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every person we encounter is facing some kind of challenge, or is carrying some kind of heartache.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our own personal struggles or heartaches maybe bigger or smaller than theirs, it makes no difference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we seek to be a blessing to everyone we meet, then both of us will be blessed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its written in Galatians 6:10, &ldquo;Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the chapter before that one, Paul beautifully summarized the Christian life with these words, &ldquo;The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love.&rdquo; (Gal. 5:6)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Living for Christ is all about loving and giving. Love makes everything lovely, especially you and me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What a great year and great life we can live if we focus on others and attempt to help every person we can!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fifth Priority - Keep Your Heart Pure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus says in Matthew. 5:8, &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Any mechanic will tell you that a clean engine runs better and delivers more power than a dirty one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same is true of a pure heart. We make a terrible mistake when we collect and retain all kinds of garbage in our hearts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of things like evil desires, resentments, malice, bitterness, jealousy, hatred and thoughts of revenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These things eat away at us like a cancer.They poison our hearts and block our ability to see God and experience a vibrant spiritual life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Scripture says in Col. 3:5-10, &ldquo;Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed, which is idolatry. Because of these, the wrath of God is coming. You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived. But now you must rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips. Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its Creator.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not trying to say that any of this is easy. But, in Romans 7, Paul talked about his very real struggle to do what he knew was right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can testify to how difficult it is for me to keep my heart and life pure, but this must be our ongoing priority.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we give into temptation and evil, and allow it to take up residence in our hearts, then our entire lives will be harmed and hindered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I believe that God will give us the relief and the resources we need to develop a pure heart and life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>God says in Rom. 7:24-25, &ldquo;What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? Thanks be to God &ndash; through Jesus Christ our Lord.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sixth Priority - Renew Your Strength Daily. One of my favorite passages is Isaiah 40:28-31, &ldquo;Do you not know? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can fathom. He gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak. Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall; but those who hope in the LORD will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just as our bodies require daily nourishment from food and water, so does our spirit. We need daily nourishment for our souls. Where can we get that nourishment?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Psalm 1:1-3 offers us an answer to that question: &ldquo;Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers. But his delight is in the law of the LORD, and on his law he meditates day and night. He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t you want that to be a picture of your life? I want my life to be like a healthy tree extracting nourishment from the soil and the stream nearby,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to encourage each of us to make it a priority this New Year to spend some time everyday with the Lord.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some of us that this has been a priority for many years. There is only one way to do so, by spending time in studying the Scripture and in prayer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It can also include fellowship with genuine Christians activities. The important thing is that we try to have a consistent time and place to meet with the Lord.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we meet with the Lord and exercise our spiritual muscles we gain the spiritual strength we need for each day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jesus demonstrated the importance of staying connected to the Father as He often made time to be alone with God, and we would do well to follow His example.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seventh Priority - Act on God&rsquo;s Promises and Commands. In Philippians 4:9, God says, &ldquo;Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me &ndash; put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no substitute for faith and obedience. God is pleased when we trust in His promises and act on His commands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we move into this new year, let&rsquo;s make it a priority to live scripturally and claim God&rsquo;s promises and in so doing walk by faith.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And when we know that there is something God wants us to do or to change, let&rsquo;s not delay in trying to do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In concluding, I wish to remind us that this New Year lies before us unspoiled, unpolluted, naked and structured by God.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>May God help us make it the best year for the Church Of Jesus Christ and for each one of us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I believe the seven priorities we have discussed today can lead us to that end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>i. Let&rsquo;s forget about yesterday;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ii. Let&rsquo;s not worry about tomorrow,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>iii. Let&rsquo;s make today count,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>iv. Let&rsquo;s help every person we can,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>v. Let&rsquo;s keep our hearts pure,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>vi. Let&rsquo;s renew our strength daily,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>vii. And let&rsquo;s act on God&rsquo;s promises and commands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let us never forget that God is everything. Without God, life is meaningless. The best of life and eternity are wrapped up in God.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will never be sorry about focusing our life on serving God.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next verse after our Scripture reading says, &ldquo;When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.&rdquo; (Col. 3:4).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s our hope and our goal! May God bless us as we walk with Him and Serve Him in this New Year!</p>"}}, {"model": "armyofjesuschrist.latestsermon", "pk": 12, "fields": {"title": "Numbered But Absent", "by": "Pastor Eric C Okechukwu", "date": "2020-05-26T13:58:06Z", "image": "sermons_pic/73472718_2366323893630491_4219217327167635456_o_SGBAsnf.jpg", "word": "<p>There is a clear reminder that you never know the true condition of the hearts of those around you. The disciples never did figure out that Judas was a traitor until after he had betrayed the Lord Jesus. They always assumed that he was one of them. Perhaps even Judas believed that all was well. Either way, it reminds us that the heart is very deceptive, Jer. 17:9. It also challenges us to be sure that we are in a saving relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ, 2 Pet. 1:10; 2 Cor. 13:5.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The one crime, which society judges hardly, for which it holds no penalty too severe, is treachery. Of other sins the world is a lenient critic, as it deals very gently with the profligate; it is full of excuses for the self-willed and violent. It has a sympathy with passion, the passion of the sensualist, or the passion of the headstrong, which softens its judgment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the traitor receives no mercy at the bar of public opinion. The betrayal of a marriage, family, friend, the betrayal of a cause, the betrayal of one&#39;s ministry and country, these are unforgiven and unforgotten crimes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even treachery to a treacherous cause is barely tolerated. The law employs it, and disguises it with a specious title. We call it &#39;turning Queen&#39;s evidence,&#39; but still it is repulsive. We avail ourselves of the treachery, but we loathe the traitor. It is an ugly name and an ugly thing, to which no social or political necessity can altogether reconcile us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Numbered but absent is the an arch-traitor. Judas betrayed a Friend, Who was the very impersonation of Love; he betrayed the cause, in which the eternal interests of mankind are bound up; he betrayed the country, of which we all are citizens, the kingdom of heaven, where we all aspire to dwell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Acts 1:16-19 KJV &ldquo;Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus. [17] For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry. [18] Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out. [19] And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a public and private life of a person, as it lives in two worlds. First, in a very public world that is visible with social responsibilities to live up. Second, is a private world that can be a place of blessing and contentment or it can be a private hell of torture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These two worlds are tied together, for what is in the heart will be played out in public no matter the packagings. Little things we do shows our character and value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A person who lives in a private world of goodness, thoughtfulness and holiness will give itself good outward deeds and output. Also, the person whose heart is unclean will absorb itself in something that may take years and then suddenly burst forth in some daring and usually dark deed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This was the very dilemma of the life of Judas, he carefully cultivated a double life. With that growing gap between his public and private self, Satan took advantage and exploited his weakness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a saint and for a preacher, public worship is important but private worship is even very much more important. Always remember that public anointing never rises higher than private anointing, so also is private discipline and value</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Worship is a human response to divine revelation. The further away we get from the Cross the greater the liability for failure. By the same token, the closer we get to the Cross the greater the degree of revelation and love for God that takes place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story of a Numbered but absent in 1:17 &ldquo;For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry&rdquo;, sums up the tragedy of Judas. He was numbered with the company but he was never a part of that enterprise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>i. He was numbered but absent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ii. He was numbered but aloof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>iii. He was numbered but distant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>iv. He was numbered but not committed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>v. He was numbered but not restrained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>vi. He was numbered but never discipled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>vii. He was numbered but never taught.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>viii. He was numbered but unconsecrated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This word numbered sums up one of the life liabilities. Our name can be listed on the roll but when we aren&rsquo;t really willing to sacrifice, to be taught, take responsibility, and be discipled, we can&rsquo;t be part of the enterprise, but a spectator and betrayer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outwardly, Judas fitted in very well, but inwardly he was in a slow state of rottenness, the corrupt process of decaying and dying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judas had been immersed and numbered but absent. How can you know if you are just &ldquo;numbered but absent&rdquo;?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. When you are never prepared for the battle, and encumbered with &ldquo;stuff&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. When you are never counting the cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>c. When you are content with carnal and all the loose ends of spiritual life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>d. When you are content with all the little besetting sins in the heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>e. When you are content with infrequent interest in fasting and prayer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>f. When you are not willing to study, for God to approve you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>g. When you not willing to make a sacrificial effort to get immersed in knowledge and worship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>h. When your actions and reactions is oppose to the vision and mission of the ministry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>i. When you are not available and accessible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>j. When you have an indifference to great spiritual truth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>k. When you are willing to settle for a small understanding of the greatness of God.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>l. When you cannot follow up programs&hellip;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scripture clearly stipulated that Judas was &ldquo;numbered,&rdquo; called and anointed with the 500, 70 and with the 12 apostles with promises and realities of grace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luke tells us that Jesus called &ldquo;the twelve&rdquo; that included Judas and &ldquo;gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases, and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal&rdquo; in Luke 9:1&ndash;2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Active involvement in ministry is a good and wonderful thing, but it is not, in itself, a guarantee of spiritual life or health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People fall into a place of danger when they begin to live in the past tense of spiritual life. Far too many are living out their existence in the past tense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Some camp-meeting experience years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Some past point in their life when their prayer was more vibrant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Some place in the past when they used to teach Bible studies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Some place in the past where they fought the devil off with a holy vehemence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Some place in the past when they were more involved in the Kingdom of God.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Some place in the past when they fought for the mountains of conquest instead of being content in the valleys of apathy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Some place in the past when they fought a much more valiant fight than now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. Some place in past tense that held victory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9. Some place in the past when their dreams for God were really big.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10. Some place in the past when the manna fell for them daily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11. Some place in the past when the glory days were still experienced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judas saw the greatest life ever lived up close and personal. No better model of faith than Jesus or a better environment for forming faith than Judas had in walking with the Savior.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He directly witnessed the miracles, signs, wonders and mighty deeds of Jesus. When 5,000 and 4000, Jesus fed, Judas was there, he took the bread and distributed it along with the other disciples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Jesus calmed the storm, walk on top of the water, raised Lazarus from the dead, gave sight to the blind, heal the dumb and deaf, Judas was there. You can&rsquo;t have better evidence for faith than Judas had.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judas heard all the teachings of Jesus, in wisdom, knowledge, insight and understanding. He heard the Sermon on the Mount, so he knew there is a narrow road that leads to life and a broad road that leads to destruction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He heard the warnings Jesus spoke to the Pharisees, so he knew there is a hell to shun and a heaven to gain. He heard the parable of the prodigal son, so he knew God is ready to welcome and forgive those who have wasted themselves in many sins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Judas&rsquo;s own eyes, he saw the clearest evidence, with his own ears, he heard the finest teaching. With his own feet, he followed the greatest example of righteousness, holiness and its liberty. And yet this man still betrayed Jesus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The human heart is beyond understanding&rdquo; in Jer. 17:9, and there is something incomprehensible about a person who abandons the faith they once professed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to understand how a young person raised by godly parents, or ministers in the context of a healthy life and church, taught the truths of Scripture from an early age, and grounded in apologetics can give up on Jesus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judas&rsquo;s story contains an important lesson for parents, leaders, ministers and friends who grieve over someone they love who has abandoned the faith.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They worry:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>i. Where did we go wrong?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ii. What more could we have done?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>iii. Did we fail in our teaching?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>iv. Did we fail in our example?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>v. Should we have immersed our son or daughter or friend, ministers, workers in a different environment?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Judas teaches us that even the best example, the most compelling evidence, and the finest teaching, the ultimate environment for incubating faith, cannot, in and of themselves, change the human heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was not long before Judas was immersed in the instruction that Jesus gave to all of His disciples. It was an amazing time for Judas as he witness -</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Never before had he heard such wisdom pour out of a man.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. He had never encountered a man who could speak, preach, or teach like Jesus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. The miracles, signs, wonders and mighty deeds were bum-fizzling to him and yet their power was astounding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. All the healings of withered limbs, the opening of stony eyes and hard ears, but what was really amazing for Judas was the dead people that were called back from the grave.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. He watched the wrenching grief turn to astronomical joy when families watched their dead ones come back to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the days passed, Judas found himself being called upon to be the treasurer for the group. Who knows when the difficulties began but obviously something started turning Judas&rsquo; heart away from and against Jesus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>i. Seeds of resentment were sown.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ii. The heart started listening to the wrong voices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>iii. Hope turned to disillusionment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>iv. Fellowship was replaced by distance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>v. Conversation disappeared and cold calculation replaced it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>vi. He became a fault founder</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judas&rsquo; real problem was that he got disappointed with God. He found himself committed to Jesus but there were a few strings attached to his commitment. Just enough commitment to get him moving but more than a lack of it to keep him distracted. He was never convicted and none converted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judas had some expectations of Jesus that He didn&rsquo;t live up to. If you serve God for any length of time, you are in for the discovery that there will be a large gap between what you expect from the faith and what you actually experience. I have known of more than one who walked away and backslid because of this dilemma, a God who did not live up to their preconceived conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. I have watched preachers backslide because of the Judas syndrome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. I have watched groups give up and quit because of this Judas element.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. I have listened almost in disbelief at the accusations that poured forth from the hearts of the disappointed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of this turned Judas into a thief and betrayer. The bag became his focus. Little by little he started taking what he had previously put into the bag. What is curious about this matter is that he wanted to take someone&rsquo;s worship away to support his dark deeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Love is better than reason. We want no reasoning, but love and conscience. Conscience which directs, and love which inspires. Love is better than reason. If we look at the contrast between the two, recall the scene in Simon&#39;s house at Bethany. There Judas reasons, while Mary loves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here we see the fault of reasoning without love and the unreasoning devotion and uncalculating abandonment of love in Mary. Of her Jesus said, &ldquo;Where so ever this Gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this be told for a memorial of her.&rdquo; Of Judas, &ldquo;Woe unto that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed; it had been good for that man if he had not been born.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Judas fell, love might have saved him, but reason killed him. When Mary broke the alabaster box, his dark heart revolted and he accused, condemned, and ranted and amazingly the disciples were influenced by his reasoning, but the Lord Jesus was not deceived, who spoke sharply to Judas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Notice the incredible contrasts between Mary&rsquo;s worship and Judas&rsquo; deceit and covetousness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>i. Judas had a money box and Mary had an alabaster box.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ii. Judas had ultimately had thirty pieces of silver and Mary had three hundred denarii.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>iii. Judas had four months worth of money and Mary had a year&rsquo;s worth of salary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>iv. Judas had about #95000 and Mary had #285000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>v. Judas loved the money and Mary loved the Lord.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>vi. Judas had a hypocritical concern for the poor and Mary had a noble desire for the Lord.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The decision and Choice Judas made, made Satan assault his soul relentlessly. We read about Satan&rsquo;s attacks on Judas in Luke 22:3-4 &ldquo;Then Satan entered into Judas Iscariot&rdquo;. Because of his perverted and unclean heart about Jesus and life, the devil have to put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon&rsquo;s son, to betray him in John 13:2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In John 13:27 &ldquo;Satan entered into him&rdquo; because Judas opened the door to Satan. He had been stealing money from the bag secretly, and going to the enemy of Jesus in secret and yet eat, din, walk, drink and sat with Jesus. Then sat down at our Lord&rsquo;s table with known sins he would not confess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unconfessed and unforsaken sin always opens the door to Satan&rsquo;s power. Satan doesn&rsquo;t gain a foothold in the lives of people who are walking in the light with Jesus. He only gains access when we open the door.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the question that faces every one of us now is how do we keep from just being &ldquo;numbered&rdquo;? The sad reality is that after you have been at it a while, there is an awareness that there have been people who sat in the church, and maybe even on the same pew where you are sitting that were nothing more than just &ldquo;numbered&rdquo; among us but absent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Numbered but absent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Numbered but aloof.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Numbered but distant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Numbered but not committed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Numbered but not restrained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Numbered but never discipled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Numbered but never taught.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. Numbered but unconsecrated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I dare say that I am preaching to some today who are only &ldquo;numbered&rdquo; among us and given a year or two or more years. . . you will manifest. How do we keep from being in that category? 2 Timothy 4:5 KJV &ldquo;But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, . . . make full proof of thy ministry&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>a. Make sure you are converted. . .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>b. Make sure you are filled with the Holy Ghost. . .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>c. Make sure you are striving to live a holy life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>d. Take heed to yourself and your thought life and make sure it is crucified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>e. Get involved and stay involved. . .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>f. Pursue a full spiritual life that pushes you toward a state of perpetual revival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Satan&rsquo;s frailty is proved by this, that he cannot approach a soul unless that soul has first turned to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you get close to Jesus, one of two things will happen: either you will become wholly his, or you will end up more alienated from him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among those who hate Christ the most, some once professed to trust him, His claims are so exclusive, and his demands so pervasive that, in the end, you must either give yourself to him completely or give him up altogether. There is no middle ground. For those who get close, the only outcomes are full devotion or eventual antagonism; and every day, each of us is heading in one direction or the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an age when many are abandoning the faith they once professed, the story of Judas warns us to guard our hearts, lest we drift away. Not as a discouragement, but as a warning to us, how the greatest spiritual privileges may be neutralised by the indulgence of one illicit passion, and the life, which is lived in the face of the unclouded sun, may set at last in the night of despair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story of Judas also equips us to reach out to those who may be close to walking away from the faith. Christ calls us in Jude 1: 22&ndash;23 to &ldquo;be merciful to those who doubt; save others by snatching them out of the fire&rdquo;. Finally, the story of Judas reminds us that nothing good can come from giving up on Jesus Christ.</p>"}}, {"model": "armyofjesuschrist.latestsermon", "pk": 15, "fields": {"title": "BELIEVERS ARE HOUSE OF PRAYER", "by": "Pastor Eric C Okechukwu", "date": "2020-05-28T09:23:40Z", "image": "sermons_pic/81201496_2429503257312554_147057841969037312_n_9hWOjNy.jpg", "word": "<p>Kingdom life is sustained by kingdom principles, of which one of such principle is called prayers.

This invisible barrier that seems to plague many Christians of good standing, is what this we are talking about today.<br />\r\nThis barrier often leaves a person and it&rsquo;s family members frustrated, confused, or in total despair.<br />\r\nIn some families, this invisible barrier causes unemployment.

The paradox is that this phenomenon seems to affect both the Christians and the non-Christians within a family.<br />\r\nThis invisible barrier is called a curse. Curses bring shame, embarrassment, frustration, and mockery.<br />\r\nGod never intended for any of His children to live under a curse.

The angels of God are with me, I have no basis to fear any man, any evil, any evil spirit. Because the Lord of hosts is with me, I take my confidence in Him. It is written If God be for us who can be against us? God is with me, I have no enough reason to fear, in the name of Jesus. It is written, The Lord is my light and my salvation whom shall, I fear? The Lord is the defense of my life of whom shall I be afraid? Though a host of demons encamp against me, my heart will not fear; though war rises against me, even in this I shall be confident. The Lord is with me like a mighty terrible one. I am not afraid. I cannot be threatened. My persecutors shall stumble and fumble. Their everlasting confusion and disgrace shall never be forgotten. God has commanded me to fear not. Of the 366 days in a year, no single day is allowed for me to fear. So, I refuse to be afraid of anything.

However, curses are not playthings and are profoundly emotionally disturbing for those who experience them. They are not just angry words or swear words; they are acts of power in the spiritual and physical realm. Curses are mentioned over 200 times in Scripture, and were foundational to the Old Covenant (Deuteronomy 28-30).<br />\r\nGod Himself was the first one to pronounce curses on the earth, on Eve&rsquo;s fertility, Adams destiny and upon the serpent. Curses are not just a primitive superstition; they are spiritual pronouncements recorded in Scripture, that profoundly affect the very structure of reality in some way, and are so much in great force today.<br />\r\nToday, we think of &quot;cursing&quot; as someone using foul language, profanity, or perhaps, even blasphemous words against God. Our definition usually is synonymous with &quot;swearing.&quot; This is a form of cursing, but it is only a small portion of what curses mean in the Bible. Cursing in the Bible is not only speaking evil of someone, but evil coming upon someone. If a person is under a curse, according to the Bible, evil has come upon them in some way.
